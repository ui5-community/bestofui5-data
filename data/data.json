Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-cfdestination\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n},\n\"ui5\": {\n  \"dependencies\": [\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-cfdestination\",\n    // ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> As the devDependencies are not recognized by the UI5 tooling, they need to be listed in the `ui5 > dependencies` array. In addition, once using the `ui5 > dependencies` array you need to list all UI5 tooling relevant dependencies.\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-middleware-cfdestination\n      afterMiddleware: compression\n      configuration:\n        authenticationMethod: \"none\" # \"none\" || \"route\", default: \"none\"\n        allowServices: true # allows BTP services like SAP IoT to be used \n        debug: true\n        port: 1091\n        xsappJson: \"xs-app.json\"\n        destinations:\n          # check that the destination name (here: \"backend\") matches your router in xs-app.json\n          - name: \"backend\"\n            url: \"https://services.odata.org/V4/(S(fdng4tbvlxgzpdtpfap2rqss))/TripPinServiceRW/\"\n```\n\n3. put the cf routing config file `xs-app.json` in the location of `$yourapp` you specified above (`xsappJson`) -  \nrecommendation is to put it at the root `/` of your UI5 app!\n\n## How it works\n\nThe middleware wraps the `@sap/approuter` npm module that is used in the SAP BTP CloudFoundry environment for serving UI5 applications, including proxying the configured destinations.\n\nDuring development, the `approuter` is started on a configurable port, running alongside the regular local `ui5-server`. When a call to a URL destination is detected at `$webserver/destination`, it is proxied to `$approuter:$port` via [`request`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request).\n\n## Misc/FAQ\n\n**q**: does authentication on destinations  \n**a**: yes, works 🥳\n\n- prerequisite: a `default-env.json` file at the root `/` of your UI5 app\nBespoken `default-env.json` file can be obtained [via the `Default Env CLI Plugin`](https://github.com/saphanaacademy/DefaultEnv)\n- `ui5.yaml > server > customMiddlware > ui5-middleware-cfdestination`: set `authenticationMethod` to `route` (see config example above)\n- `xs-app.json` (also at the root `/` of your UI5 app):\n  - set `authenticationMethod` to `route`\n  - in the route with the desired protected authentication, set `authenticationType` to `xsuaa`  \n\nsee `./test/auth/**/*` for example files for the above!\n\n**q**: what's `allowLocalDir` for?  \n**a**: allows to protect local static assets (e.g. `html` files) -in addition to destinations- with approuter as well.  \nsee `test/auth/xs-app-with-localDir.json` for an example!\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

UI5 middleware for syncing interactions across browsers\n\nMiddleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), syncing interactions between different browsers, hopefully somewhat easing

It transmits user interactions of the UI via a websocket pool. Respectively, all browsers connected to `http://ui5-app:port` open a websocket connection, listening for and receiving interactions events.  \n\nAdditionally, `iasync` injects custom HTML into `index.html`, manipulating browser event handlers of UI5 controls - see `lib/ui5mangler.html`. E.g. the `sap.m.Button`'s click event is overwritten with its' tap event.\n\n## Misc/FAQ\n\n> Watch Out!  \n> Due to manipulation of the UI5 controls (see above), interactions of the UI might lead to unexpected results!\n\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

The reload is `#`-aware, meaning the current displayed route in your single-page UI5 app is kept steady.\n\n## HTTP/2 support\n\nThe middleware supports HTTP/2 automatically, when the UI5 server is started with the --h2 option. It uses the same SSL key and certificate, either set using the --key and --cert options, or using the default ~/.ui5/server/server.key and ~/.ui5/server/server.crt.\n\n## Misc/FAQ\n\nyep, cross-browser, cross-platform.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

UI5 middleware for live transpiling ES6+ sources\n\nMiddleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), doing on-the-fly transpilation of ES6+ sources to ES5 (incl IE11 compatability :) )\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-middleware-livetranspile --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- debug: true|false  \nverbose logging\n\n- excludePatterns: `String<Array>`  \narray of paths inside `$yourapp/webapp/` to exclude from live transpilation,  \ne.g. 3-rd party libs in `lib/*`\n\n- transpileAsync: `true|false`  \ntranspiling `async/await`  using [this Babel plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-async-to-promises), which doesn't require  \nthe regenerator runtime ([Issue #242](https://github.com/petermuessig/ui5-ecosystem-showcase/issues/242))\n\n- babelConfig: `Object`  \nobject to use as configuration for babel instead of the default configuration  \ndefined in this middleware\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-livetranspile\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n},\n\"ui5\": {\n  \"dependencies\": [\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-livetranspile\",\n    // ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> As the devDependencies are not recognized by the UI5 tooling, they need to be listed in the `ui5 > dependencies` array. In addition, once using the `ui5 > dependencies` array you need to list all UI5 tooling relevant dependencies.\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-livetranspile\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      debug: true\n      transpileAsync: true\n      excludePatterns:\n      - \"lib/\"\n      - \"another/dir/in/webapp\"\n      - \"yet/another/dir\"\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nThe middleware intercepts every `.js`-file before it is sent to the client. The file is then transpiled on-the-fly via `babel`, including dynamic creation of a `sourcemap`.\n\nThe transpiled code and the `sourcemap` are subsequently delivered to the client instead of the original `.js`-file. Because of the `sourcemap`, setting breakpoints in the **original (ES6+) source** will cause the debugger to stop **when the corresponding transpiled source code is reached**.\n\n> `async/await` is transpiled at runtime, but the required `asyncGenerator` sources are not yet delivered on the fly. They need to be `sap.ui.require`d or `<script src=\"...\">`d separately. Alternatively you can use the babel plugin `babel-plugin-transform-async-to-promises` as described [here](../ui5-task-transpile/README.md).\n\n## Extending the default configuration (in `$yourapp/babel.config.json`)\n\nIf you want to further customize the transpiling options you can do so by creating a babel config file `babel.config.json` in your project directory. The behavior is identical to that of `ui5-task-transpile`. For more details and examples consult the [documentation of `ui5-task-transpile`](../ui5-task-transpile/README.md).\n\n## Override babel configuration (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\nYou can override the default babel configuration from this package by including an object `babelConfig` in this task's configuration. The behavior is identical to that of `ui5-task-transpile`. For more details and examples consult the [documentation of `ui5-task-transpile`](../ui5-task-transpile/README.md).\n\n## Misc/FAQ\n\n`.js`-files requested by the server that are missing in the application (such as `Component-preload.js`) are logged as a `WARN` message, but will not cause the middleware to break/stop.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License. The official license will be Apache 2.0 but finally you can choose between one of them if you use this work.\n\nWhen you like this stuff, buy [@vobu](https://twitter.com/vobu) a beer or buy

UI5 onelogin middleware\n\nMiddleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), enabling a generic login support.\n\nThe middleware will on first request try to login with the provided credentials and save the cookie for further requests. This uses playwright in a headless mode to run the login process.\nThe first request will take longer.\n\nThis has been tested with Azure AD, Google, OpenAM and the SAP Gateway login pages.\n\nMerge requests with other login handlers are more than welcome via pull request.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-middleware-onelogin --save-dev\n\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\nCurrently you can define the properties in the configuration (see below) or the following environment variables are used.\n\n- path: `string` the url to the fiori launchpad or just hostname and port of the SAP system, /sap/bc/ui2/flp will then be automatically added\n- username`(optional)`: `string` Username to be used to login to the launchpad\n- password`(optional)`: `string`Password used to login\n- useCertificate`(optional)`: `boolean` use a certificate to login instead of username and password\n- debug`(optional)`: `boolean` true will open up the playwright browser so you can see what's going on\n\n**NB:** If you choose to use the certificate login then check the property AutoSelectCertificateForUrls in chrome://policy if it holds the url pattern for your system. [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/1799) has an issue to handle the certificate prompt. Another workaround is to set debug and useCertificate to true in the configuration and press ok when the prompt opens\n\nYou can either add the following properties to your .env file, remember to add that to your .gitignore\n\n- UI5_MIDDLEWARE_ONELOGIN_LOGIN_URL or UI5_MIDDLEWARE_SIMPLE_PROXY_BASEURI\n- UI5_MIDDLEWARE_ONELOGIN_USERNAME\n- UI5_MIDDLEWARE_ONELOGIN_PASSWORD\n\nUse of environment variables or values set in a `.env` file will be used.\n\nOther options is to either set it in the yaml file or if left blank it will prompt you for the details.\n\nYou can choose to just add the url and let the rest be prompted in the terminal\n![Login prompt](./assets/prompt.png)\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-onelogin\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n},\n\"ui5\": {\n  \"dependencies\": [\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-onelogin\",\n    // ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> As the devDependencies are not recognized by the UI5 tooling, they need to be listed in the `ui5 > dependencies` array. In addition, once using the `ui5 > dependencies` array you need to list all UI5 tooling relevant dependencies.\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-middleware-onelogin\n      afterMiddleware: compression\n      configuration:\n        path: <Login URL>\n        username: <Login User>\n        password: <Login Password>\n        useCertificate: true / false (use a certificate to login instead of username and password)\n        debug: true / false (true will open up the playwright browser so you can see what's going

UI5 simple proxy middleware\n\nMiddleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), enabling proxy support.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-middleware-simpleproxy --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- baseUri: `string`\n  The baseUri to proxy. Can also be set using the `UI5_MIDDLEWARE_SIMPLE_PROXY_BASEURI` environment variable.\n- strictSSL: `boolean`\n  Ignore strict SSL checks. Default value `true`. Can also be set using the `UI5_MIDDLEWARE_SIMPLE_PROXY_STRICT_SSL` environment variable.\n- limit: `string`\n  This sets the body size limit (default: `1mb`). If the body size is larger than the specified (or default) limit,\n  a `413 Request Entity Too Large`  error will be returned. See [bytes.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bytes) for\n  a list of supported formats.\n- removeETag:  `boolean`\n  Removes the ETag header from the response to avoid conditional requests.\n- username:  `string`\n  Username used for Basic Authentication.\n- password:  `string`\n  Password used for Basic Authentication.\n- httpHeaders: `map`\n  Http headers set for the proxied request. Will overwrite the http headers from the request. \n- query: `map`\n  Query parameters set for the proxied request. Will overwrite the parameters from the request. \n- excludePatterns: `string[]`\n  Array of exclude patterns using glob syntax\n- skipCache: `boolean`\n  Remove the cache guid when serving from the FLP launchpad if it matches an excludePattern\n\nIn general, use of environment variables or values set in a `.env` file will override configuration values in the `ui5.yaml`.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-simpleproxy\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n},\n\"ui5\": {\n  \"dependencies\": [\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-simpleproxy\",\n    // ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> As the devDependencies are not recognized by the UI5 tooling, they need to be listed in the `ui5 > dependencies` array. In addition, once using the `ui5 > dependencies` array you need to list all UI5 tooling relevant dependencies.\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-simpleproxy\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    mountPath: /odata\n    configuration:\n      baseUri: \"https://services.odata.org\"\n      username: myUsername\n      password: myPassword\n      httpHeaders:\n        Any-Header: AnyHeader\n      query:\n        sap-client: '206'\n      excludePatterns:\n      - \"/local/**\"\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nThe middleware launches a simple `proxy`-server which proxies the requests to the given uri. Internally, it uses the express proxy middleware.\n\n## How to ignore self-signed certificates?\n\nIn case you are using HTTPS and self-signed certificates, you may see an error as displayed below:\n\n```bash\nError: unable to verify the first certificate\n    at TLSSocket.onConnectSecure (_tls_wrap.js:1321:34)\n    at TLSSocket.emit (events.js:210:5)\n    at TLSSocket._finishInit (_tls_wrap.js:794:8)\n    at TLSWrap.ssl.onhandshakedone (_tls_wrap.js:608:12)\n```\n\nTo avoid it, you can set the `strictSSL` value in proxy request to be `false`. Its default value is `true`.\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-simpleproxy\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    mountPath: /odata\n    configuration:\n      baseUri: \"http://services.odata.org\"\n      strictSSL: false\n```\n\n## .env support\n\nThis plugin supports use of a `.env` file to declare environment variable values for configuration as described above. The file should be put in the same directory where you run `ui5 build`, `ui5 serve`, etc. The file might have contents like:\n\n```shell\nUI5_MIDDLEWARE_SIMPLE_PROXY_BASEURI=https://host.tld:1234/sap\nUI5_MIDDLEWARE_SIMPLE_PROXY_STRICT_SSL=false\nUI5_MIDDLEWARE_SIMPLE_PROXY_USERNAME=myUsername\nUI5_MIDDLEWARE_SIMPLE_PROXY_PASSWORD=myPassword\n```\n\n## Hints\n\nIf you are using the Microsoft OData services for testing purposes, like Northwind, please ensure to use the `https` URLs instead of the `http` URLs. The `http` URL will redirect to `https` but instead of the proxy it will try to directly connect to the Microsoft OData services.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

UI5 middleware for live string replace in files\n\nMiddleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), doing a live string replace on files matched by the includePatterns `files` array configuration option.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\n# Using npm\nnpm install ui5-middleware-stringreplacer --save-dev\n\n# Using pnpm\npnpm add --save-dev ui5-middleware-stringreplacer\n\n# Using yarn\nyarn add --dev ui5-middleware-stringreplacer\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- debug: true|false  \n  verbose logging\n- files: `string`|`array`  \n  Placeholders will be replaced with their values in files matched by this glob pattern\n- replace: `array`  \n  List of placeholder, value pairs\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-stringreplacer\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n},\n\"ui5\": {\n  \"dependencies\": [\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-stringreplacer\",\n    // ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> As the devDependencies are not recognized by the UI5 tooling, they need to be listed in the `ui5 > dependencies` array. In addition, once using the `ui5 > dependencies` array you need to list all UI5 tooling relevant dependencies.\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-middleware-stringreplacer\n      afterMiddleware: compression\n      configuration:\n        debug: true\n        files:\n          - \"**/*.js\"\n          - \"**/*.xml\"\n        replace:\n          - placeholder: ${project.artifactId}\n            value: my.sample.app\n          - placeholder: ${project.version}\n            value: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT\n          - placeholder: \"{{app.AppTitle}}\"\n            value: My Sample App\n```\n\n3. Maintain all string placeholders and values in `.env` file\n\n```env\nstringreplacer.BASE_URL_PLACEHOLDER = http://localhost:2000\nstringreplacer.some.deeply.nested.ANOTHER_PLACEHOLDER = Replace with this text\n```\n\n## Multiple environments\n\nYou can keep multiple `.env` files and load a specific environment at build or serve time.\n\n```\n- dev.env\n- staging.env\n- prod.env\n- package.json\n```\n\n```json\n \"scripts\": {\n    \"serve:dev\": \"UI5_ENV=dev ui5 serve\",\n    \"serve:staging\": \"UI5_ENV=staging ui5 serve\",\n    \"serve:prod\": \"UI5_ENV=prod ui5 serve\",\n }\n```\n\nWith `UI5_ENV` set, the strings will be loaded from the `<UI5_ENV>.env` file.\n\n## How it works\n\nThe middleware replaces the placeholders with their values in the files matched by the patterns. All the string placeholders which are maintained in the process environment with prefix 'stringreplacer.' will be taken into account. If no environment name is set through the process environment variable UI5_ENV, then by default the file`./.env` is loaded.\n","subPath":"packages/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/","jsdoc":{},"downloadsCurrentMonth":101,"downloadsCurrentFortnight":63,"downloads365":1597,"downloadsFortnightGrowth":65.79,"downloadsHistory":[{"yearMonth":"2021-09","downloads":93},{"yearMonth":"2021-10","downloads":110},{"yearMonth":"2021-11","downloads":90},{"yearMonth":"2021-12","downloads":111},{"yearMonth":"2022-01","downloads":77},{"yearMonth":"2022-02","downloads":153},{"yearMonth":"2022-03","downloads":94},{"yearMonth":"2022-04","downloads":191},{"yearMonth":"2022-05","downloads":213},{"yearMonth":"2022-06","downloads":256},{"yearMonth":"2022-07","downloads":119}],"npmlink":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer","versions":[{"version":"created","date":"2020-09-29T12:13:09.886Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/created","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"0.2.0","date":"2020-09-29T12:13:10.120Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.2.0","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"modified","date":"2022-06-26T10:22:54.590Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/modified","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"0.2.1","date":"2021-01-06T07:54:13.960Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.2.1","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"0.2.2","date":"2021-05-05T19:24:40.402Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.2.2","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"0.2.3","date":"2021-08-07T20:04:24.142Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.2.3","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"0.2.4","date":"2021-09-29T18:46:38.369Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.2.4","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"0.2.5","date":"2021-10-29T20:23:05.391Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.2.5","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"0.3.0","date":"2021-12-26T09:54:44.907Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.3.0","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"0.3.1","date":"2022-02-22T20:21:33.834Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.3.1","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"0.3.2","date":"2022-02-24T20:28:10.911Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.3.2","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"0.3.3","date":"2022-04-11T11:40:06.998Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.3.3","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"0.3.4","date":"2022-04-19T08:29:47.070Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.3.4","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"0.3.5","date":"2022-05-22T20:38:46.463Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.3.5","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"0.3.6","date":"2022-05-23T07:04:02.230Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.3.6","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"0.3.7","date":"2022-06-03T20:09:36.559Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.3.7","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"0.4.0","date":"2022-06-22T05:38:20.318Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.4.0","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"0.4.1","date":"2022-06-26T10:22:54.513Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.4.1","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"}]},{"name":"ui5-middleware-webjars","version":"0.4.0","description":"UI5

By default, this allows to consume static resources from the JAR files from within the `META-INF/resources/` path. When using JAR files following a derived web static resources concept it is possible to override the JAR root path with the configuration `jarRootPath`.\n\n```text\njarRootPath: \"META-INF/resources/\"\n\nMETA-INF/resources/my/resource/path/Resource.js => http://localhost:8080/my/resource/path/Resource.js\n\n---\njarRootPath: \"META-INF/\"\n\nMETA-INF/resources/my/resource/path/Resource.js => http://localhost:8080/resources/my/resource/path/Resource.js\n```\n\n## Development\n\nIf you want to contribute to `ui5-middleware-webjars`, please use [`Prettier`](https://prettier.io) for code formatting/style and apply the rules from `./.prettierrc`.

UI5 task for minifying XML resources (like views, fragments, etc.)\n\nTask for [ui5-builder](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-builder), enabling XML minification based on [minify-xml](https://github.com/kristian/minify-xml#readme).\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-task-minify-xml --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- minifyOptions: `Object`\n  all options available from the [minify-xml](https://github.com/kristian/minify-xml#options) plugin, with one additional (non-compliant) `collapseWhitespaceInAttributeValues` (`boolean`) option, due to UI5 having a lot of options (e.g. with JSON values) where collapsing whitespace is beneficial. defaults to all standard options of `minify-xml` and `collapseWhitespaceInAttributeValues` enabled.\n\n- fileExtensions: `String|Array<String>`\n  the file extensions to glob for. defaults to `xml`.\n\n- excludePatterns: `Array<String>` \n  array of paths inside `$yourapp/` to exclude from the minification, e.g. 3-rd party libs in `lib/*`. defaults to an empty array `[]`.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-task-minify-xml\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n},\n\"ui5\": {\n  \"dependencies\": [\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-task-minify-xml\",\n    // ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> As the devDependencies are not recognized by the UI5 tooling, they need to be listed in the `ui5 > dependencies` array. In addition, once using the `ui5 > dependencies` array you need to list all UI5 tooling relevant dependencies.\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n  - name: ui5-task-minify-xml\n    afterTask: replaceVersion\n    configuration:\n      minifyOptions:\n        removeComments: true\n        collapseEmptyElements: true\n        collapseWhitespaceInAttributeValues: true\n        # ... further minify-xml attributes\n      fileExtensions:\n      - \"xml\"\n      - \"edmx\"\n      excludePatterns:\n      - \"lib/\"\n      - \"another/dir/in/webapp\"\n      - \"yet/another/dir\"\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [licensed](../../LICENSE) under the Apache 2.0 license.\n","subPath":"packages/ui5-task-minify-xml/","jsdoc":{},"downloadsCurrentMonth":136,"downloadsCurrentFortnight":89,"downloads365":813,"downloadsFortnightGrowth":89.36,"downloadsHistory":[{"yearMonth":"2021-09","downloads":14},{"yearMonth":"2021-10","downloads":64},{"yearMonth":"2021-11","downloads":34},{"yearMonth":"2021-12","downloads":17},{"yearMonth":"2022-01","downloads":14},{"yearMonth":"2022-02","downloads":78},{"yearMonth":"2022-03","downloads":32},{"yearMonth":"2022-04","downloads":127},{"yearMonth":"2022-05","downloads":156},{"yearMonth":"2022-06","downloads":106},{"yearMonth":"2022-07","downloads":77}],"npmlink":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-minify-xml","versions":[{"version":"created","date":"2021-08-07T20:04:24.145Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-minify-xml/v/created","changelog":"","sourceType":"task"},{"version":"0.2.0","date":"2021-08-07T20:04:24.256Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-minify-xml/v/0.2.0","changelog":"","sourceType":"task"},{"version":"modified","date":"2022-06-22T05:38:21.896Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-minify-xml/v/modified","changelog":"","sourceType":"task"},{"version":"0.2.1","date":"2021-10-28T21:10:55.118Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-minify-xml/v/0.2.1","changelog":"","sourceType":"task"},{"version":"0.2.2","date":"2021-10-29T20:23:06.618Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-minify-xml/v/0.2.2","changelog":"","sourceType":"task"},{"version":"0.2.3","date":"2022-02-07T22:15:32.215Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-minify-xml/v/0.2.3","changelog":"","sourceType":"task"},{"version":"0.2.4","date":"2022-04-11T11:40:08.671Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-minify-xml/v/0.2.4","changelog":"","sourceType":"task"},{"version":"0.2.5","date":"2022-04-19T08:29:56.671Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-minify-xml/v/0.2.5","changelog":"","sourceType":"task"},{"version":"0.2.6","date":"2022-05-22T20:38:48.072Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-minify-xml/v/0.2.6","changelog":"","sourceType":"task"},{"version":"0.2.7","date":"2022-05-23T07:04:03.637Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-minify-xml/v/0.2.7","changelog":"","sourceType":"task"},{"version":"0.3.0","date":"2022-06-22T05:38:21.828Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-minify-xml/v/0.3.0","changelog":"","sourceType":"task"}]},{"name":"ui5-task-pwa-enabler","version":"0.3.1","description":"UI5 task to make a PWA out of a UI5 application.","author":"Mona Kaczun, Maximilian Moehl","license":"Apache-2.0","repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/ui5-community/ui5-ecosystem-showcase.git","directory":"packages/ui5-task-pwa-enabler"},"scripts":{"lint":"eslint lib"},"dependencies":{"@ui5/fs":"^2.0.6","graceful-fs":"4.2.10","jsdom":"^20.0.0","mustache":"^4.2.0","parse5":"^7.0.0"},"ui5":{"dependencies":[]},"type":"task","tags":["pwa","ui5-ecosystem-showcase"],"gitHubOwner":"ui5-community","gitHubRepo":"ui5-ecosystem-showcase","licenseSource":"beer-ware","forks":63,"stars":150,"addedToBoUI5":"2022-04-09T11:37:57.868Z","createdAt":"2020-05-26T23:40:15.394Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-26T10:22:55.385Z","vscodeInstalls":-1,"sourceType":"task","githublink":"https://github.com/ui5-community/ui5-ecosystem-showcase/tree/main/packages/ui5-task-pwa-enabler/","readme":"# UI5 task for turning a UI5 App into a PWA\n\n[What are Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)?](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/)\n\n## Install\n\n`npm install ui5-task-pwa-enabler --save-dev`\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\nIf you are familiar with jsonschema check out the config.json.\n\n### `serviceWorker`\n\n`strategy`\n\nDefines how the service worker should behave. Possible values are\n\n* `Offline-Page` The App will display a offline page when it cannot connect to the internet. Requires `offlinePage` parameter.\n* `Offline-Copy` While browsing the App, the Service Worker captures all files and stores them in the cache.\n* `Offline-Copy-With-Backup-Page` A combination of the above two. Requires `offlinePage` parameter.\n* `Cache-First` This option pre-caches all given files and serves them from the cache first. Requires `preCacheFiles` parameter.\n* `Advanced-Caching` With this option you have very granular control about which files should be cached, and which shouldn't. Requires all of the parameters below.\n\n`offlinePage`: Sets the page that will be shown if the user is offline, should be a `.html` file somewhere in your project. Only required for `Offline-Page`, `Offline-Copy-With-Backup-Page`, `Advanced-Caching`.\n\n`preCache`: List of [glob pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) that match the files that will be pre cached when the application starts. Only required for `Cache-First` and `Advanced-Caching` strategies.\n\n`networkFirst`: List of regular expressions, everything that matches any of the expressions will be fetched from the network first and only served from cache when there is no network available. Only required for `Advanced-Caching`.\n\n`avoidCaching`: List of regular expressions, everything that matches any of the expressions won't be cached. Only required for `Advanced-Caching`\n\n### `manifest`\n\nWhatever you supply here will be copied to the `manifest.webmanifest` file, you can read more about it at [web.dev](https://web.dev/add-manifest/). If a required parameter is missing a default value will be provided.\n\n## Usage\n\n### 1. Define the dependency in your `package.json`\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    \"ui5-task-pwa-enabler\": \"*\"\n},\n\"ui5\": {\n    \"dependencies\": [\n        \"ui5-task-pwa-enabler\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Configure it in your `ui5.yaml`\n\nThis is a example configuration for an advanced service worker and some custom manifest parameters.\n\n```yaml\nspecVersion: '1.0'\nmetadata:\n  name: openui5-sample-app\ntype: application\nresources:\n  configuration:\n    propertiesFileSourceEncoding: \"UTF-8\"\nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n    - name: ui5-task-pwa-enabler\n      afterTask: generateVersionInfo\n      configuration:\n        serviceWorker:\n          strategy: Advanced-Caching\n          offlinePage: offline.html\n          preCache:\n            - \"controller/*\"\n            - \"*.html\"\n            - \"view/*\"\n            - \"images/*\"\n          networkFirst:\n            - /\\/api\\/.*/\n          avoidCaching:\n            - /\\/realtime-api\\/.*/\n        manifest:\n          short_name: To-Do App\n          name: To-Do App\n          description: Sample to-do-app for testing pwaEnabler\n          icons:\n            - src: images/SAP_R_192.png\n              type: image/png\n              sizes: 192x192\n            - src: images/SAP_R_512.png\n              type: image/png\n              sizes: 512x512\n          start_url: /index.html\n          scope: /\n          background_color: \"#EFF4F9\"\n          theme_color: \"#3F5161\"\n          display: standalone\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nUnder the hood we are using the examples from the [pwabuilder](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwabuilder-serviceworkers)\nbut we replaced the configuration part with templating and generate those values from the provided configuration.\nAdditionally we have to inject a few lines into the `index.html` to make sure everything is linked and tadaa, you have\nyour own fancy PWA.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

`array`  \n  List of placeholder, value pairs\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-task-stringreplacer\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n},\n\"ui5\": {\n  \"dependencies\": [\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-task-stringreplacer\",\n    // ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> As the devDependencies are not recognized by the UI5 tooling, they need to be listed in the `ui5 > dependencies` array.

Maintain all string placeholders and values in `.env` file\n\n```env\nstringreplacer.BASE_URL_PLACEHOLDER = http://localhost:2000\nstringreplacer.some.deeply.nested.ANOTHER_PLACEHOLDER = Replace with this text\n```\n\n## Multiple environments\n\nYou can keep multiple `.env` files and load a specific environment at build or serve time.\n\n```\n- dev.env\n- staging.env\n- prod.env\n- package.json\n```\n\n```json\n \"scripts\": {\n    \"build:dev\": \"UI5_ENV=dev ui5 build\",\n    \"build:staging\": \"UI5_ENV=staging ui5 build\",\n    \"build:prod\": \"UI5_ENV=prod ui5 build\",\n }\n```\n\nWith `UI5_ENV` set, the strings will be loaded from the `<UI5_ENV>.env` file.\n\n## How it works\n\nThe task reads all files based on configuration patterns and replaces all string placeholders with values for all files. All the string placeholders which are maintained in the process environment with prefix 'stringreplacer.' will be taken into account. If no environment name is set through the process environment variable UI5_ENV, then by default the file`./.env` is loaded.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

UI5 task for transpiling ES6+ sources\n\nTask for [ui5-builder](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-builder), enabling transpiling.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-task-transpile --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- debug: `true|false`  \n  verbose logging\n\n- removeConsoleStatements: `true|false`  \n  remove console statements while transpiling using [Babel plugin](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-remove-console)\n\n- excludePatterns: `String<Array>`  \n  array of paths inside `$yourapp/webapp/` to exclude from live transpilation,  \n  e.g. 3-rd party libs in `lib/*`\n\n- transpileAsync: `true|false`  \n  transpiling `async/await` using [this Babel plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-async-to-promises), which doesn't require  \n  the regenerator runtime ([Issue #242](https://github.com/petermuessig/ui5-ecosystem-showcase/issues/242))\n\n- babelConfig: `Object`\n  object to use as configuration for babel instead of the  \n  default configuration defined in this middleware\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-task-transpile\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n},\n\"ui5\": {\n  \"dependencies\": [\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-task-transpile\",\n    // ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> As the devDependencies are not recognized by the UI5 tooling, they need to be listed in the `ui5 > dependencies` array. In addition, once using the `ui5 > dependencies` array you need to list all UI5 tooling relevant dependencies.\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n  - name: ui5-task-transpile\n    afterTask: replaceVersion\n    configuration:\n      debug: true\n      removeConsoleStatements: true\n      transpileAsync: true\n      excludePatterns:\n      - \"lib/\"\n      - \"another/dir/in/webapp\"\n      - \"yet/another/dir\"\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nThe task can be used to transpile ES6+ JavaScript code to ES5 by using `babel`.\n\n## Extending the default configuration (in `$yourapp/babel.config.json`)\n\nIf you want to further customize the transpiling options you can do so by creating a babel config file `babel.config.json` in your project directory. Babel will automatically pick up the configuration and apply it. The default configuration from this task will still be applied.\n\n### Example\n\nAn example configuration is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    [\"@babel/plugin-transform-for-of\", { \"assumeArray\": true }],\n    [\"@babel/plugin-transform-computed-properties\", { \"loose\": true }],\n    [\"@babel/plugin-transform-destructuring\", { \"loose\": true }]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Additional dependencies\n\nIf you need dependencies not included in this task you have to install them in your project in order to be able to use them.\n\n## Override babel configuration (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\nYou can override the default babel configuration from this package by including an object `babelConfig` in this task's configuration. If such an object is given the default configuration from this task will not be considered, but only the configuration given in `ui5.yaml` will be used.\n\n### Example\n\n```yaml\nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n    - name: ui5-task-transpile\n      afterTask: replaceVersion\n      configuration:\n        excludePatterns:\n          - \"lib/\"\n        babelConfig: &babelConfig\n          plugins:\n            - - \"@babel/plugin-transform-computed-properties\"\n              - loose: true\n            - - \"@babel/plugin-transform-for-of\"\n              - assumeArray: true\n          presets:\n            - - \"@babel/preset-env\"\n              - targets:\n                  browsers: \"last 2 versions, ie 10-11\"\n```\n\n> Hint: if you also use use `ui5-middleware-livetranspile` you probably do not want to duplicate the babel configuration in your `ui5.yaml`. Use YAML anchors in order to reference the babel configuration across the `ui5.yaml` file.\n> In the example above the anchor `&babelConfig` defines the babel configuration of `ui5-task-transpile` and may be re-used in other parts of `ui5.yaml` by using the alias `*babelConfig`:\n>\n> ```yaml\n> server:\n>   customMiddleware:\n>   - name: ui5-middleware-livetranspile\n>     afterMiddleware: compression\n>     configuration:\n>       babelConfig:\n>         <<: *babelConfig\n>         sourceMaps: \"inline\"\n> ```\n\n### Additional dependencies\n\nIf you need dependencies not included in this task you have to install them in your project in order to be able to use them.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

UI5 Tooling Extensions for NPM Package Consumption\n\n> **DISCLAIMER**: This is a community project and there is no official support for this package! Also the functionality may stop working at any time in future with newer versions of the UI5 tooling!\n\nThe UI5 tooling extensions include a custom middleware and a custom task which allow to use NPM package names for AMD-like dependencies, e.g.:\n\n```bash\n# Install a dev dependency to Chart.js (https://www.chartjs.org/)\nnpm install chart.js\n```\n\n```js\n// use Chart.js as a AMD-like dependency\nsap.ui.define([\n  \"chart.js\"\n], function(chartjs) {\n  [...]\n  alert(chartjs.version);\n  [...]\n})\n```\n\nOnce the UI5 application is finally built, the Chart.js dependency will be copied into the `dist/resources` folder with the proper namespace. In case of Chart.js above, there is no namespace and thus the location will be `dist/resources/chart.js.js`.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-tooling-modules --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- *verbose*: `boolean`  \n  Enables verbose logging (defaults to `false`)\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *prependPathMappings*: `boolean`  \n  Prepends the path mappings for the UI5 loader to the `Component.js` which allows to run the Component using 3rd party modules in e.g. Fiori launchpad environments (defaults to `false`)\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *addToNamespace*: `boolean`\n  Puts 3rd party modules into the namespace of the Component to make them Component-local. All used 3rd party modules will be moved into the sub-namespace `thirdparty` of the Component namespace at build time. With that option you can run your application using 3rd party modules in a Fiori launchpad environment. (defaults to `false`, disables *prependPathMappings* when set to `true`)\n  &nbsp;\n  > :warning: While this works great for any non-UI5 3rd party module, there are limitations for the consumption of UI5 modules from custom control 3rd party modules (NPM packages). The UI5 module names (used for `Object.extend(...)`, aggregation types, ...) are not rewritten and this may cause issues. UI5 assumes that the used module path (slash syntax) is matching the module name (dot syntax). This can lead to issues for `Object.isA(...)` checks, Renderer lookups (when not inlined or referenced by module), or for any other API which derives the module name from the module path or vice versa.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-tooling-modules\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n},\n\"ui5\": {\n  \"dependencies\": [\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-tooling-modules\",\n    // ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> As the devDependencies are not recognized by the UI5 tooling, they need to be listed in the `ui5 > dependencies` array. In addition, once using the `ui5 > dependencies` array you need to list all UI5 tooling relevant dependencies.\n\n2. Configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\nThe configuration for the custom task:\n\n```yaml\nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n    - name: ui5-tooling-modules-task\n      afterTask: replaceVersion\n```\n\nThe configuration for the custom middleware:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-tooling-modules-middleware\n      afterMiddleware: compression\n```\n\n> :warning: In case your application is using a proxy such `fiori-tools-proxy`, the proxy must run after `ui5-tooling-modules-middleware` middleware. Otherwise proxy will try to serve the resources for your installed npm package instead of `ui5-tooling-modules-middleware`. You can achieve this by setting `afterMiddleware: ui5-tooling-modules-middleware` in `fiori-tools-proxy` middleware.\n\n## How it works\n\nThe custom middleware is listening to incoming requests and checks those requests to match npm packages. E.g. a dependency to `chart.js` will cause a request to `resource/chart.js.js`. The middleware now derives the module name which is `\"chart.js\"` and uses `require.resolve(\"chart.js\")` to lookup the npm package for it. If an npm package exists, the middleware is using `rollup` to create a custom AMD bundle for the npm package which uses `sap.ui.define` instead of `define`.\n\nThe custom task is scanning all AMD dependencies of all modules and tries to resolve the module names. If a module has been found a custom bundle will be created in the proper namespace of the module, e.g. `@apollo/client/core` will create a custom bundle at `dist/resources/@apollo/client/core.js`.\n\n## How to obtain support\n\nPlease use the GitHub bug tracking system to post questions, bug reports or to create pull requests.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAny type of contribution (code contributions, pull requests, issues) to this showcase will be equally appreciated.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

UI5 custom control `ui5-cc-md`\n\nThis namespace contains a custom control rendering regular + github-flavored Markdown content, either provided as a string or from a file.  \nIt outputs plain HTML, ready to be included in an XML view.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\n$> yarn add ui5-cc-md\n# or\n$> npm install ui5-cc-md\n```\n\n## Included controls\n\n- `Markdown`: transforms Markdown to HTML\n  - properties: (note: either `content` or `fromFile` can be used, not both)\n    - `content: <String>`: Markdown as raw string\n    - `fromFile: <Path>`: relative path to a file containing Markdwon\n  - aggregations: -\n\n## Usage\n\n1. define the dependeny in `$yourapp/package.json`\n\n   ```json\n   // it is already in \"dependencies\" after installation\n   \"ui5\": {\n     \"dependencies\": [\n       // ...\n       \"ui5-cc-md\",\n       // ...\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. declare the namespace in your XML view and use the custom control from that namespace\n\n   ```xml\n   <mvc:View ... \n           xmlns:md=\"cc.md\"\n           ...>\n      <md:Markdown content=\"***markdown is nice!***&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;if only there wasn't the CR problem in XML view string\" />\n      <md:Markdown fromFile=\"./fragment.md\" />\n      <md:Markdown content=\"{/markdownContent}\" />\n   </mvc:View>\n   ```\n\n## How it works\n\n`Markdown` uses the [npm module `marked`](https://marked.js.org) for transforming content from Markdown to HTML.\n\n## Build time (in apps)\n\nUse `ui5 build --all` to produce a deployable version of your app including `ui5-cc-md` and its’ control(s).\n\nOther than that, nothing specific to note for using `ui5-cc-md` in builds in UI5 apps.\n\n## Tests\n\nThe `test` folder contains a minimal UI5 app requiring `ui5-cc-md`. \n\nFor testing manually, do:\n\n```bash\n$> yarn test:manual # runs ui5 serve\n# now point a browser to http://localhost:8080\n```\n\nThe [livereload middleware](https://github.com/petermuessig/ui5-ecosystem-showcase/tree/master/packages/ui5-middleware-livereload) is included, so changes to the test app get reloaded immediately.\n\nA full automated test suite is setup with [Jest + puppeteer](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/puppeteer), starting `ui5 serve` and running all `/test/**/*.test.js` :\n\n```bash\n$> cd test/ui5-app\n$> yarn # for installing runtime dependencies\n$> cd ..\n$> yarn test\n# sample output:\n PASS  test/ui5-app/basic.test.js\n  Markdown\n    ✓ should render markdown via content property (2374 ms)\n    ✓ should render markdown

official UI5 tooling and support multiple deployment targets such as the SAP Business Technology Platform. This generator was build as a plug-in for the community project [Easy-UI5](https://github.com/SAP/generator-easy-ui5/) by [SAP](https://github.com/SAP/).\n\n> As of version `0.1.0`, we strive to share core functionality (such as webapp scaffolding) with [SAP's `open-ux-tools`](https://github.com/SAP/open-ux-tools) effort, which is \"a set of tools and libraries that makes it faster and easier to develop SAP Fiori applications\".\n\n## Usage with easy-ui5\n\n```bash\n$> npm i -g yo\n$> yo easy-ui5 project\n\n     _-----_\n    |       |    ╭──────────────────────────╮\n    |--(o)--|    │  Welcome to the easy-ui5 │\n   `---------´   │        generator!        │\n    ( _´U`_ )    ╰──────────────────────────╯\n    /___A___\\   /\n     |  ~  |\n   __'.___.'__\n ´   `  |° ´ Y `\n```\n\n![generation flow](./docs/embeddedUsage.gif)\n\nRun you can use `npm start` (or `yarn start`) to start the local server for development.\n\n## Standalone usage\n\nNote the different greeting when the generator starts.\n\n```bash\n$> npm i -g yo\n$> yo ./generator-ui5-project\n\n     _-----_     ╭──────────────────────────╮\n    |       |    │      Welcome to the      │\n    |--(o)--|    │     easy-ui5-project     │\n   `---------´   │        generator!        │\n    ( _´U`_ )    ╰──────────────────────────╯\n    /___A___\\   /\n     |  ~  |\n   __'.___.'__\n ´   `  |° ´ Y `\n```\n\n![generation flow](./docs/standaloneUsage.gif)\n\n## Target platforms\n\nDuring the prompting phase, the generator will ask on which target platform your app should run. Currently, the following options are available:\n\n### Static webserver\n\nThis is the most basic option. Choose this option if you want to deploy the web app in your custom environment or host it on an arbitrary server.\n\n### Application Router @ Cloud Foundry\n\nThis is the most basic way to deploy the web app in Cloud Foundry-based environments. Besides the basic UI5 project, the generator will add an [Approuter](https://github.com/gregorwolf/SAP-NPM-API-collection/tree/master/apis/approuter) node.js-module that serves the web app.\n\n### Application Router @ SAP HANA XS Advanced\n\nThis is the standard way to deploy the web app in SAP HANA XSA-based environments. Besides the basic UI5 project, the generator will add an [Approuter](https://github.com/gregorwolf/SAP-NPM-API-collection/tree/master/apis/approuter) node.js-module that serves the web app.\n\n### SAP HTML5 Application Repository service for SAP BTP\n\nThis option is a more sophisticate way to serve the web app from Cloud Foundry-based environments. The generator will include all modules that are included in the **Application Router @ Cloud Foundry** and, additionally, install a module to upload the web app to the HTML5 application repository during deploy-time. You can watch [this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emnl-y9btdU&list=PLVf0R17F93RXT2tzhHzAr-iiYTmc9KngS&index=11&t=0s) to learn more about the benefits of using the HTML5 application repository.\n\n### SAP Launchpad service\n\nUse this option if you would like to develop a Fiori Launchpad application that should run on Cloud Foundry. The generator will include all modules that are included in the **SAP HTML5 Application Repository service for SAP BTP** and, additionally, install a module that adds Fiori Launchpad resources to the HTML5 application repository.\n\n### SAP NetWeaver\n\nUse this option if you want to deploy your application(s) to the SAP NetWeaver ABAP Repository.\n\n## Sub-generators to avoid recurring tasks\n\n### Add a new view\n\nThis sub-generator will create a new view (of the same type you specified during the creating of your project) and a new controller and route. If you have OPA5 tests, you can add a corresponding page object now or later with another sub-generator.\n\n```shell\n$> yo easy-ui5 project newview\n```\n\n### Create a custom control\n\nRun the following command from your project's root to scaffold a custom control.\n\n```shell\n$> yo easy-ui5 project newcontrol\n```\n\n### Add a new model\n\nThis sub-generator will create a new model in your manifest. Currently, [JSON](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.json.JSONModel) and [OData v2](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel) models are supported with various configuration options.\n\n```shell\n$> yo easy-ui5 project newmodel\n```\n\n### Add a new component usage\n\nThis sub-generator will add a new component usage for component reuse to your manifest.\n\n```shell\n$> yo easy-ui5 project newcomponentusage\n```\n\n### OPA5 tests\n\nThis sub-generator will add a basic [OPA5](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/topic/2696ab50faad458f9b4027ec2f9b884d) test setup. You can add page objects now or later with another sub-generator.\n\n```shell\n$> yo easy-ui5 project opa5\n```\n\nThis sub-generator will create an OPA5 page object and add it to your journeys:\n\n```shell\n$> yo easy-ui5 project newopa5po\n```\n\nThis sub-generator will create an OPA5 journey and add it to your test page:\n\n```shell\n$> yo easy-ui5 project newopa5journey\n```\n\n### QUnit tests\n\nThis sub-generator will add a basic [QUnit](https://qunitjs.com/) setup. It will ask you for your app name and namespace if it is not yet part of an easy-ui5 project. You can add QUnit tests now or later with the `newqunittest` sub-generator.\n\n```shell\n$> yo easy-ui5 project qunit\n```\n\nThis sub-generator will create a new QUnit test either in a basic setup or with [Sinon.JS](https://sinonjs.org/) to create standalone test spies, stubs and mocks in your QUnit tests:\n\n```shell\n$> yo easy-ui5 project newqunittest\n```\n\n### UIVeri5 tests\n\nThis sub-generator will add a basic [UIVeri5](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-uiveri5) test. It will ask you for test configuration and names of the suite and spec. You can add page objects now or later with another sub-generator.\n\n```shell\n$> yo easy-ui5 project uiveri5\n```\n\nThis sub-generator will create a UIVeri5 page object and a new test that shows how to use the page object:\n\n```shell\n$> yo easy-ui5 project newuiveri5po\n```\n\nThis sub-generator will create a UIVeri5 spec file:\n\n```shell\n$> yo easy-ui5 project newuiveri5spec\n```\n\n## Deployment\n\nDepending on your target platform you'll need to install additional tools:\n\n### Cloud Foundry\n\nRequired tools:\n\n1. [Create a free account](https://developers.sap.com/mena/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html) on SAP BTP Trial\n2. [Install](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-cf-download-cli.html) the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface\n\n    ```shell\n    cf login\n    ```\n\n3. [Install](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/multiapps-cli-plugin) the MultiApps CF CLI Plugin\n\nDeployment steps:\n\nCall this command from the root directory to deploy the application to Cloud Foundry\n\n```shell\n$> npm run deploy\n```\n\n### SAP HANA XSA\n\nRequired tools:\n\n1. SAP HANA or [create a free](https://developers.sap.com/group.hxe-install-binary.html) SAP HANA Express system\n2. [Install](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hxe-ua-install-xs-xli-client.html) the XS CLI Client\n\n    ```shell\n    $> xs login\n    ```\n\nDeployment steps:\n\nCall this command from the root directory to deploy the application to HANA XSA\n\n```shell\n$> npm run deploy\n```\n\n### SAP NetWeaver\n\nDeployment steps:\n\nUpdate the ui5.yaml file with your system settings (user, password & server) and ABAP repository settings (package, BSP Container & Transport).\nRun following command to deploy the application to SAP NetWeaver\n\n```shell\n$> npm run deploy\n```\n\n## Shared functionality with SAP's `open-ux-tools`\n\n-   scaffolding a new webapp with view type `XML` uses [`@sap-ux/fiori-freestyle-writer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap-ux/fiori-freestyle-writer)\n\n## Embedded Technologies\n\nThis project leverages (among others) the following Open Source projects:\n\n-   [UI5 Build and Development Tooling](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling)\n-   [OpenUI5. Build Once. Run on any device.](https://github.com/SAP/openui5)\n-   [SAP open-ux-tool](https://github.com/SAP/open-ux-tools)\n\n## Debugging the generator\n\nIf you want to modify and debug this (or any other Yeoman) generator, I recommend the following trick that leverages the capabilities of VS Code:\n\nYou need to add an `npm script` to trigger this generator from the \"npm scripts\" panel. To make your life a bit easier, I have already added such a script here.\n\n> Note that the generator will be called from the project root, which means all files will be generated here then. This might not be ideal in your situation, but you can always open another project in VS Code and add an npm script that calls this generator from there as well. Be aware that you need to change the path of the generator then.\n\nOnce the npm script is set up, you need to set a breakpoint in the logic of the generator itself (here in the index.js). Once all (conditional) breakpoints are set, hit the debug button of the npm script that you want to trigger. \n![debug](./docs/debugBreakpoint.png)\nWithin a few seconds, you'll see that the generator is started, and the debugger will be attached and eventually stop at your breakpoint. \n![debug](./docs/debugStopped.png)\n\nNow you are ready to go, happy coding 🦁!\n\n\n## Support\n\nPlease use the GitHub bug tracking system to post questions, bug reports or to create pull requests.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome any type of contribution (code contributions, pull requests, issues) to this generator equally.\n\n[test-image]: https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-project/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg\n[test-url]: https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-project/actions/workflows/main.yml\n[prettier-img]: https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square\n[prettier-url]: https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square\n[license-image]: https://img.shields.io/github/license/ui5-community/generator-ui5-project.svg\n[license-url]: https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-project/blob/main/LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt\n[slack-img]: https://img.shields.io/badge/openUI5-slack-yellow\n[slack-url]: https://openui5.slack.com\n[node-img]: https://img.shields.io/badge/node-%3E%3D16-green?style=flat&logo=nodedotjs\n[node-url]: https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/\n[nvm-img]: https://img.shields.io/badge/nvm-enabled-9cf?style=flat&logo=gnubash\n[nvm-url]: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm\n[yeoman-img]: https://img.shields.io/badge/easy--ui5-generator-red?style=flat&logo=data:image/png;base64,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\n[yeoman-url]: https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman\n","downloadsCurrentMonth":-1,"downloadsCurrentFortnight":-1,"downloads365":-1},{"name":"generator-ui5-ts-app","version":"1.0.1","description":"Yeoman-based (sub-)generator for a basic UI5 application based on TypeScript","main":"index.js","scripts":{"test":"cd test && yo ../../generator-ui5-ts-app"},"keywords":["ui5","typescript","application","yeoman generator"],"author":"Peter Muessig <peter.muessig@sap.com>","repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-ts-app.git"},"license":"apache-2.0","dependencies":{"chalk":"^4.1.2","package-json":"^7.0.0","yeoman-generator":"^5.5.2","yosay":"^2.0.2"},"devDependencies":{"@types/jest":"^27.4.0","jest":"^27.4.7","yeoman-assert":"^3.1.1","yeoman-test":"^6.2.0"},"type":"generator","tags":["typescript"],"gitHubOwner":"ui5-community","gitHubRepo":"generator-ui5-ts-app","licenseSource":"apache-2.0","forks":9,"stars":8,"addedToBoUI5":"2022-04-14T00:00:00.007Z","createdAt":"2021-05-28T07:02:25Z","updatedAt":"2022-08-01T15:48:08Z","vscodeInstalls":-1,"sourceType":"generator","githublink":"https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-ts-app/tree/main/","readme":"# generator-ui5-ts-app\n\n[![License Status][license-image]][license-url]\n\nGenerator which use the official UI5 tooling and support multiple deployment targets such as the SAP Business Technology Platform.

It automatically benefits from all the available [UI5 Community generators](https://github.com/ui5-community/?q=generator-ui5&type=all&language=&sort=).\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThis NPM packages just adds a few more options to use the Easy-UI5 Yeoman generator - but even a bit easier...\n\n### Option 1: Using `npm-init`\n\nThe [`npm-init`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-init) command is used to setup new repositories. You can use the `create-easy-ui5` package for `npm-init` like this:\n\n```sh\nnpm init easy-ui5 [template]\n```\n\nThe `create-easy-ui5` package doesn't need to be installed upfront to be used as `npm-init` is downloading it automatically from the central NPM registry.\n\n### Option 2: Using `npx`\n\nThe [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx) command is used to run NPM packages directly and can be used to run the setup script:\n\n```sh\nnpx create-easy-ui5 [template]\n```\n\nThe `create-easy-ui5` package doesn't need to be installed upfront to be used as `npm-init` is downloading it automatically from the central NPM registry.\n\n### Option 3: Using `easy-ui5` binary\n\nThe `easy-ui5` binary is provided by the `create-easy-ui5` NPM package and once installed it can be used to setup new repositories using the Easy-UI5 Yeoman generator:\n\n```sh\n# Install create-easy-ui5\nnpm i -g create-easy-ui5\n\n# Run the binary\neasy-ui5 [template]\n```\n\n##

Platform. This generator was build as a plug-in for the community project [Easy-UI5](https://github.com/SAP/generator-easy-ui5/) by [SAP](https://github.com/SAP/).\n\n## Usage with easy-ui5\n\n```bash\n$> npm i -g yo\n$> yo easy-ui5 ts-app-fcl\n\n     _-----_\n    |       |    ╭──────────────────────────╮\n    |--(o)--|    │  Welcome to the easy-ui5 │\n   `---------´   │        generator!        │\n    ( _´U`_ )    ╰──────────────────────────╯\n    /___A___\\   /\n     |  ~  |\n   __'.___.'__\n ´   `  |° ´ Y `\n```\n\nAfter the generation of your project you can use `npm start` (or `yarn start`) to start the local development server.\n\n## Standalone usage\n\nNote the different greeting when the generator starts:\n\n```bash\n$> npm i -g yo\n$> yo ./generator-ui5-ts-app-fcl\n\n     _-----_     ╭──────────────────────────╮\n    |       |    │    Welcome to the        │\n    |--(o)--|    │ generator-ui5-ts-app-fcl │\n   `---------´   │      generator!          │\n    ( _´U`_ )    ╰──────────────────────────╯\n    /___A___\\   /\n     |  ~  |\n   __'.___.'__\n ´   `  |° ´ Y `\n```\n## Options\nBesides the options you have in the basic TypeScript template like appname and namespace, we have added more options that will be used to configure the OData service:\n### EndPoint\nThis should be an endpoint that points to the Service Document of your OData service, like for example the northwind service: https://services.odata.org/V2/OData/OData.svc/\n### EntitySet\nBased on the provided OData Service Document, the generator will provide you a list of all available OData EntitySets. You will be able to select one as your main EntitySet. The Master page will show a list of all entries in this EntitySet, while the detail page will show the details of the selected entry.\n### Key\nThe next option is the key. You'll have to select the field you would like to use as the main key. This will be used in the routing configuration as parameter to navigate to the detail page.\n### Title\nThe title option will be bound to the title in the list as well as on the detail page.\n### Other Field\nThis last one is an open and free field to bind a second field to the table and on the detail page. It can be a numbe or a description of the title. Just one additional field to kickstart your project!\n\n## Support\n\nPlease use the GitHub bug tracking system to post questions, bug reports or to create pull requests.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome any type of contribution (code contributions, pull requests, issues) to this generator equally.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the Apache Software License, version 2.0 except as noted otherwise in the LICENSE file.\n\n[license-image]: https://img.shields.io/github/license/ui5-community/generator-ui5-ts-app-fcl.svg\n[license-url]: https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-ts-app-fcl/blob/main/LICENSE\n\n---------------------------\n###### This generator is provided to you by Peter Muessig and Wouter Lemaire","downloadsCurrentMonth":-1,"downloadsCurrentFortnight":-1,"downloads365":-1},{"name":"generator-template-ui5-flp-plugin","version":"0.0.1","description":"(Sub-)generator for a UI5 Fiori Launchpad Plugin","scripts":{"test":"mocha","workaround":"find . -name '.DS_Store' -delete","test:manual":"cd test/ui5-app && ui5 serve","prettier":"prettier --write ."},"keywords":["yeoman-generator","sap","sapui5","openui5","ui5","project-template","flp-plugin","fiori-launchpad-plugin"],"author":"SAP (Amar Ubhe)","license":"apache-2.0","repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-flp-plugin.git"},"files":["helpers","generators"],"dependencies":{"chalk":"^4.1.0","glob":"^7.1.6","object-assign-deep":"^0.4.0","valid-filename":"^3.1.0","yaml":"^1.10.2","yeoman-environment":"^3.2.0","yeoman-generator":"^4.13.0","yosay":"^2.0.2"},"devDependencies":{"execa":"^5.0.0","mocha":"^8.3.2","prettier":"2.2.1","yeoman-assert":"^3.1.1","yeoman-test":"^3.0.0"},"type":"generator","tags":["flp"],"gitHubOwner":"ui5-community","gitHubRepo":"generator-ui5-flp-plugin","licenseSource":"apache-2.0","forks":0,"stars":2,"addedToBoUI5":"2022-04-14T00:00:00.007Z","createdAt":"2021-07-05T15:02:32Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:41:01Z","vscodeInstalls":-1,"sourceType":"generator","githublink":"https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-flp-plugin/tree/master/","readme":"# Generator for SAPUI5 Fiori Launchpad Plugin\n> Generator for UI5 Fiori Launchpad Plugin using UI5 Tooling.

Currently, the following options are available:\n\n### Static webserver\n\nThis is the most basic option. Choose this option if you want to deploy the web app in your custom environment or host it on an arbitrary server.\n\n### SAP Launchpad service\n\nUse this option if you would like to develop a Fiori Launchpad application that should run on Cloud Foundry. The generator will install a module that adds Fiori Launchpad resources to the HTML5 application repository.\n\n### SAP NetWeaver\n\nUse this option if you want to deploy your application(s) to the SAP NetWeaver ABAP Repository.\n\n## Test Application\n```bash\nnpm run test\n```\n\n## Deployment\n\nDepending on your target platform you'll need to install additional tools:\n\n### Cloud Foundry\n\nRequired tools:\n\n1.

library collects javascript errors and can send them to a backend, if errors need to be logged and saved for further analysis:\n\n* vanilla [js errors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/error_event) (reference, syntax, type, etc)\n* Promises with [unhandled rejections](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/unhandledrejection_event)\n* UI5 log events from [sap/base/Log](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/index.html#/api/module:sap/base/Log)\n* errors from [Report API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Reporting_API)\n\n## Demo\n\nYou can check out a live demo here:\n\n<https://mauriciolauffer.github.io/openui5-error-collector/demo/index.html>\n\n## Project Structure\n\n* demo - Library's live demo\n* dist - Distribution folder which contains the library ready to use\n* src  - Development folder\n* test - Testing framework for the library\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall openui5-error-collector as an npm module\n\n```sh\n$ npm install openui5-error-collector\n```\n\n### How to use\n\nImport openui5-error-collector to your UI5 application as a regular javascript file. You should import it before `sap-ui-bootstrap` to  capture UI5 bootstrap errors as well.\n\n```html\n<script async src=\"dist/ui5ErrorCollector.min.js\"></script>\n<script async id=\"sap-ui-bootstrap\" src=\"/resources/sap-ui-core.js\" ... ></script>\n```\n\nOnce imported, all errros will be automatically captured. It also exposes a global variable `ui5ErrorCollector`, eg, `window.ui5ErrorCollector` which can be used to get the errors and to set the details to send them to a backend server.\n\n#### Sending errors to a backend\n\nDevelopers can send all errors to a backend server setting `serverUrl` with method `ui5ErrorCollector.setConfiguration`. Once `serverUrl` is set, errors'll be sent to it using `navigator.sendBeacon` (this is not supported by IE11).\n\n```js\nui5ErrorCollector.setConfiguration({\n  serverUrl: 'https://my-backend-server.com'\n});\n```\n\nTo make it compatible with IE11, or to add any extra logic when synchronizing (transform the payload, send to multiple backends, etc), a callback `onSyncHook` ca be passed to method `ui5ErrorCollector.setConfiguration`. This'll replace the default behaviour and use the provided callback `onSyncHook` rather than `navigator.sendBeacon`.\n\n```js\n/**\n * Callback provided to replace default sync with backend server\n *\n * @param {string} serverUrl - Server URL\n * @param {UI5ErrorLogEvent[]} errors - List of captured errors, same as ui5ErrorCollector.getErrors() results\n */\nfunction myCustomOnSyncHook(serverUrl, errors) {\n  // Go crazy, do whatever you wanna here...\n  const payload = JSON.stringify(errors);\n  fetch(serverUrl, {body: payload, method: 'POST'});\n  $.ajax(serverUrl, {body: payload, method: 'POST'});\n}\n\nui5ErrorCollector.setConfiguration({\n  serverUrl: 'https://my-backend-server.com',\n  onSyncHook: myCustomOnSyncHook\n});\n```\n\n#### Retrieving errors\n\nMehod `ui5ErrorCollector.getErrors` will return all captured errors.\n\n```js\nui5ErrorCollector.getErrors(); // Which returns an array of the following object:\n\n/**\n* @type {object}\n* @property {string} type - Log event type\n* @property {string} timestamp - When event was logged\n* @property {string} uri - Where event was logged\n* @property {?string} stack - Error stack\n* @property {string} message - Error message\n* @property {?string} component - UI5 Log component\n* @property {number} level - Log level\n* @property {?number} elapsedTimestamp - Elapsed time since page load\n* @property {?string} filename - File which triggered the error\n*/\n\n// Some data sample:\n[\n  {\n      \"type\": \"error\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"2022-02-14T05:59:02.987Z\",\n      \"uri\": \"http://localhost:3000/test/webapp/index.html\",\n      \"stack\": \"TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'substring')\\n    at http://localhost:3000/test/webapp/index.html:30:40\",\n      \"message\": \"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'substring')\",\n      \"component\": null,\n      \"level\": 1,\n      \"elapsedTimestamp\": 755.1999999880791,\n      \"filename\": \"http://localhost:3000/test/webapp/index.html\"\n  },\n  {\n      \"type\": \"deprecation\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"2022-02-14T05:59:03.294Z\",\n      \"uri\": \"http://localhost:3000/test/webapp/index.html\",\n      \"stack\": null,\n      \"message\": \"Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience.

extended and smarter version of UI5 MockServer for meaningful mock data.\n\nOpenUI5 Smart MockServer uses the open source library Faker.js to generate better fake data for testing your app or for a demo.\nYou can use any available method in [Faker.js](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/#api-methods).\n\nSmart data can be automatically generated based on OData SAP Semantics Annotations. You don't need to code anything, just run Smart MockServer with a metadata.xml containing SAP Semantics Annotations.\nIn case your metadata.xml doesn't have SAP Semantics annotations, you can set Smart Rules manually mapping the OData property to a Faker.js method.\n\n*Regular MockServer:* just a bunch of texts and numbers\n![Regular MockServer](./mockserver.png)\n\n*Smart MockServer:* meaningful data, better for tests and presentations to customer\n![Smart MockServer\">](./smartmockserver.png)\n\n## OData SAP Semantics Annotations\n\nOData SAP Semantic Annotations tell which of the OData properties contain e.g. a phone number, a part of a name or address, or something related to a calendar event or an analytic query. This is important for apps running on mobile devices that want to seamlessly integrate into contacts, calendar, and telephony.\n<https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/EmTech/SAP+Annotations+for+OData+Version+2.0#SAPAnnotationsforODataVersion2.0-Property_sap_semanticsAttributesap:semantics>\n\nSmart MockServer will generate data for these properties automatically, but not for all of them, have a look at the demo to see the supported *sap:semantics* annotations.\n\n## Faker.js\n\nFor any references, please follow\n\nFaker.js: <https://github.com/marak/Faker.js>\n\nFaker.js methods: <https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/#api-methods>\n\n## Demo\n\nYou can check out a live demo here:\n\n<https://mauriciolauffer.github.io/openui5-smart-mockserver/demo/webapp/index.html>\n\nAnd for a live demo using ServiceWorker:\n\n<https://mauriciolauffer.github.io/openui5-smart-mockserver/demo-sw/webapp/index.html>\n\n## Project Structure\n\n* demo - Library's live demo\n* demo-sw - Library's live demo with ServiceWorker\n* dist - Distribution folder which contains the library ready to use\n* src  - Development folder\n* test - Testing framework for the library\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall openui5-smart-mockserver as an npm module\n\n```sh\n$ npm install openui5-smart-mockserver\n```\n\n### Configure manifest.json\n\nAdd the library to *sap.ui5/dependencies/libs* and set its path in *sap.ui5/resourceRoots* in your manifest.json file, as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sap.ui5\": {\n    \"dependencies\": {\n      \"libs\": {\n        \"openui5.smartmockserver\": {}\n      }\n    },\n    \"resourceRoots\": {\n      \"openui5.smartmockserver\": \"./FOLDER_WHERE_YOU_PLACED_THE_LIBRARY/openui5/smartmockserver/\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### How to use\n\nYou can use Smart MockServer just like you use your old MockServer!\nImport openui5-smart-mockserver to your UI5 controller using *sap.ui.define* or *sap.ui.require*:\n\n```javascript\nsap.ui.define([\n    'openui5/smartmockserver/SmartMockServer'\n  ], function (SmartMockServer) {\n    'use strict';\n\n    return {\n      init: function() {\n        const metadataUrl = 'local/path/to/the/file/metadata.xml';\n        const mockServerUrl = 'odata/service/url';\n        const mockServer = new SmartMockServer({ rootUri: mockServerUrl });\n\n        // You only need to call this method in case your metadata.xml doesn't have sap:semantics annotations\n        // and you want to create nice data for the OData property\n        mockServer.setSmartRules(this._getSmartRules());\n\n        SmartMockServer.config({\n          autoRespond: true,\n          autoRespondAfter: 1\n        });\n\n        mockServer.simulate(metadataUrl, {\n          bGenerateMissingMockData: true\n        });\n\n        mockServer.start();\n      },\n\n      _getSmartRules: function() {\n      //Here we define the smart rules for entity's properties\n        const smartRules = []; //Smart rules must be an array with objects such as the following example\n        smartRules.push({\n          entityName: 'Employee', //Entity Name\n          properties: [\n            {\n              name: 'FirstName', // Entity's property name\n              fakerMethod: 'name.firstName' //Faker.js method which will be used for this property\n            },\n            { name: 'Address', fakerMethod: 'address.streetAddress' },\n            { name: 'Phone', fakerMethod: 'phone.phoneNumber' },\n            { name: 'Email', fakerMethod: 'internet.email' }\n          ]\n        });\n        return smartRules;\n      }\n    };\n  }\n);\n```\n\n## Author\n\nMauricio Lauffer\n\n* LinkedIn:

OpenUI5 library which extends JSONModel to support CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It uses fetch (not jQuery.ajax) to send requests to the server and populates a JSON Model with the responses.\nAs aforementioned, OpenUI5 CRUD JSON Model uses fetch hence it returns Promises.\n\n## Demo\n\nYou can check out a live demo here:\n\n<https://mauriciolauffer.github.io/openui5-model-json-crud/demo/webapp/index.html>\n\n![Demo Screenshot](./openui5-model-json-crud.png)\n\n## Project Structure\n\n* demo - Library's live demo\n* dist - Distribution folder which contains the library ready to use\n* src  - Development folder\n* test - Testing framework for the library\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall openui5-model-json-crud as an npm module\n\n```sh\n$ npm install openui5-model-json-crud\n```\n\n### Configure manifest.json\n\nAdd the library to *sap.ui5/dependencies/libs* and set its path in *sap.ui5/resourceRoots* in your manifest.json file, as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sap.ui5\": {\n    \"dependencies\": {\n      \"libs\": {\n        \"openui5.model.json.crud\": {}\n      }\n    },\n    \"resourceRoots\": {\n      \"openui5.model.json.crud\": \"./FOLDER_WHERE_YOU_PLACED_THE_LIBRARY/openui5/model/json/crud/\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### How to use\n\nImport openui5-model-json-crud to your UI5 controller using *sap.ui.define* or *sap.ui.require*:\n\n```javascript\nsap.ui.require([\n  'openui5/model/json/crud/CRUDModel'\n], function(CRUDModel) {\n  const serviceUrl = 'https://api.jikan.moe/v3/'; //backend root URL\n  const crudModel = new CRUDModel(serviceUrl);\n  this.getView().setModel(crudModel, 'CRUDModel');\n  //'search/anime?q=DBZ' is the path to the service to be called, it'll be concatenated to serviceUrl\n  //'/DBZ' is the path to the property into the model, in case you want to updated the model with the response;\n  // empty value does not update the local model, it only returns the response\n  crudModel.read('search/anime?q=DBZ', '/DBZ')\n    .then(function() {\n      console.log('Data selected from API');\n    })\n    .catch(function(err) {\n      console.error(err.toString());\n    });\n});\n```\n\n## Author\n\nMauricio Lauffer\n\n*

This module is under development and it is not part of the official SAP ui5-tooling. For now, it uses a custom version of ui5-cli for deployment capabilities. It's heavily inspired on ui5-build.\n\nFeel free to contribute to the project. PRs are welcome  =)\n\n## Deploy to\n\nYou should be able to deploy to:\n\n- SAP Netweaver: ABAP server (via OData or ADT)\n- SAP Cloud Platform: NEO environment\n- SAP Cloud Platform: Cloud Foundry environment\n\n## Project Configuration\n\nTypically located in a ui5.yaml file per project. You have 3 options for remote systems. They share some configuration, but each one has its own specific details.\n\nThis is the basic setup for ui5-deployer shared across all remote system options, it does not include the specific details for a given remote system. Some of the properties are not required, some are.\n\n### Properties\n\n#### *\\<root>*\n\nThe ui5.yaml file from your Fiori/UI5 application/library should have a new section called **deployer**. Deployer section has the following parameters:\n\n#### ui5.yaml file for *deployer*\n\n`deployer`: root attribute, all deployer details go under it\n- `type`: Indicates the remote system where the project will be deployed. Must be `sap-netweaver` || `sap-cp-neo` || `sap-cp-cf`\n- `sourcePath`: Path to the folder where your production ready project is\n- `connection`: Connection details to the remote system\n  - `url`: URL endpoint to connect to the remote system\n  - `proxy` (optional): an HTTP proxy to be used\n  - `strictSSL` (optional): if true, requires SSL certificates to be valid. Note: to use your own certificate authority, you need to specify the path to the SSL Certificate. Must be `true` || `false`. Default is `false`.\n  - `SSLCertificatePath` (optional): path to the SSL Certificate in case you are using your own certificate authority\n- `credentials`: Credentials to be used when accessing the remote system. This section will be removed soon as it might be a huge security issue. One might end up pushing username/password to the git repo. Username/password should be passed via CLI command only.\n  - `username`: Username\n  - `password`: Password\n- `sapCloudPlatform` (optional): SAP Cloud Platform target\n  - `neo` (optional): NEO environment target\n    - `account`: SAP CP NEO Account\n    - `cliPath` (optional):  In case neo CLI is not global, inform the path to it. <https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/7613dee4711e1014839a8273b0e91070.html>\n  - `cloudFoundry` (optional): CF environment target\n    - `org`: Organization\n    - `space`: Space\n    - `cliPath` (optional): In case cf CLI is not global, inform the path to it. <https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli>\n- `abapRepository` (optional): SAP NetWeaver ABAP Repository target\n  - `client`: SAP client/mandt\n  - `language`: SAP Logon Language\n  - `transportRequest`: ABAP Transport Request Number\n  - `package`: ABAP Package\n  - `bspApplication`: BSP Application name\n  - `bspApplicationText`: BSP Application description\n  - `method`: `adt` || `odata`. Default is `adt`. ADT API endpoint is `/sap/bc/adt`. OData API endpoint is `/sap/opu/odata/UI5/ABAP_REPOSITORY_SRV`. ADT is the default to avoid breaking old projects. However, OData is recommended for better performance, it doesn't send multiples files, it sends just a single ***.zip** containing the whole project.\n  - `skipAdtValidations` (optional): Does not validate the existence of some ADT APIs, ABAP packages and Transport Requests used during deployment. Used for older ABAP versions where these ADT APIs are not available. Must be `true` || `false`. Default is `false`.\n  - `appIndexCalculate` (optional): Calculation of SAPUI5 Application Index for SAPUI5 Repositories (/UI5/APP_INDEX_CALCULATE). See [SAPUI5 Application Index](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/c5e7098474274d3eb7379047ab792f1f). Must be `true` || `false`.

This option follows the [Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/config) best practices. The tool also supports `.env` files.\n\nThe expected Environment Variables are:\n\n```dosini\nUI5_DEPLOYER_USERNAME=MY_SAP_USER\nUI5_DEPLOYER_PASSWORD=MY_SAP_PASSWORD\nUI5_DEPLOYER_ABAP_TR=ABAPDK999999\nUI5_DEPLOYER_NEO_CLIPATH=/path/to/neo/cli/\nUI5_DEPLOYER_CF_SPACE=dev\n```\n\nIf you are using `.env` files, do not push them to your git repo as you may expose the secrets to everbody! Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.\n\n## Build and Test\n\nTODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests.\n","downloadsCurrentMonth":511,"downloadsCurrentFortnight":262,"downloads365":5071,"downloadsFortnightGrowth":5.22,"downloadsHistory":[{"yearMonth":"2021-09","downloads":428},{"yearMonth":"2021-10","downloads":422},{"yearMonth":"2021-11","downloads":262},{"yearMonth":"2021-12","downloads":191},{"yearMonth":"2022-01","downloads":245},{"yearMonth":"2022-02","downloads":651},{"yearMonth":"2022-03","downloads":460},{"yearMonth":"2022-04","downloads":528},{"yearMonth":"2022-05","downloads":352},{"yearMonth":"2022-06","downloads":479},{"yearMonth":"2022-07","downloads":435}],"npmlink":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-deployer","versions":[{"version":"created","date":"2020-03-05T10:23:42.410Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-deployer/v/created","changelog":"","sourceType":"command"},{"version":"0.1.0","date":"2020-03-05T10:23:42.525Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-deployer/v/0.1.0","changelog":"","sourceType":"command"},{"version":"modified","date":"2022-05-22T16:28:08.868Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-deployer/v/modified","changelog":"","sourceType":"command"},{"version":"0.1.1","date":"2020-03-05T23:24:07.127Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-deployer/v/0.1.1","changelog":"","sourceType":"command"},{"version":"0.1.2","date":"2020-03-20T01:41:28.718Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-deployer/v/0.1.2","changelog":"","sourceType":"command"},{"version":"0.1.3","date":"2020-03-26T04:20:35.507Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-deployer/v/0.1.3","changelog":"","sourceType":"command"},{"version":"0.1.4","date":"2020-03-26T04:45:17.274Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-deployer/v/0.1.4","changelog":"","sourceType":"command"},{"version":"0.1.5","date":"2020-03-26T22:17:01.860Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-deployer/v/0.1.5","changelog":"","sourceType":"command"},{"version":"0.1.6","date":"2020-05-08T06:00:42.072Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-deployer/v/0.1.6","changelog":"","sourceType":"command"},{"version":"0.2.1","date":"2020-05-12T04:47:34.168Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-deployer/v/0.2.1","changelog":"","sourceType":"command"},{"version":"0.2.2","date":"2020-05-13T00:45:47.451Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-deployer/v/0.2.2","changelog":"","sourceType":"command"},{"version":"0.3.0","date":"2020-08-25T12:55:15.469Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-deployer/v/0.3.0","changelog":"","sourceType":"command"},{"version":"1.0.0","date":"2021-01-05T22:41:31.286Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-deployer/v/1.0.0","changelog":"","sourceType":"command"},{"version":"1.0.1","date":"2021-02-23T23:17:48.045Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-deployer/v/1.0.1","changelog":"","sourceType":"command"},{"version":"1.1.0","date":"2021-05-13T07:04:01.748Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-deployer/v/1.1.0","changelog":"","sourceType":"command"},{"version":"1.1.1","date":"2021-05-27T00:10:53.808Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-deployer/v/1.1.1","changelog":"","sourceType":"command"},{"version":"0.4.1","date":"2022-04-25T01:57:42.391Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-deployer/v/0.4.1","changelog":"","sourceType":"command"}]},{"name":"ui5-task-dts-generator","version":"1.0.0","description":"Task for ui5-builder which generates d.ts files (TypeScript type declaration file)","author":"Mauricio Lauffer","license":"MIT","homepage":"https://github.com/mauriciolauffer/ui5-task-dts-generator#readme","private":false,"main":"lib/index.js","files":["lib/**","ui5.yaml"],"keywords":["ui5","task","builder","tooling","dts","typescript","types"],"scripts":{"test":"npm run lint","lint":"eslint lib","lint:fix":"eslint lib --fix"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/mauriciolauffer/ui5-task-dts-generator.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mauriciolauffer/ui5-task-dts-generator/issues"},"dependencies":{"@ui5/dts-generator":"^2.3.0","@ui5/fs":"^2.0.6","@ui5/logger":"^2.0.1"},"devDependencies":{"@types/node":"^16.9.1","eslint":"^7.7.0","eslint-config-mlauffer-nodejs":"^1.0.0"},"type":"task","tags":["builder","tooling","dts","typescript","types"],"gitHubOwner":"mauriciolauffer","gitHubRepo":"ui5-task-dts-generator","licenseSource":"mit","forks":0,"stars":2,"addedToBoUI5":"2022-07-10T11:52:00.000Z","createdAt":"2021-08-14T23:58:06.758Z","updatedAt":"2022-05-22T16:30:13.290Z","vscodeInstalls":-1,"sourceType":"task","githublink":"https://github.com/mauriciolauffer/ui5-task-dts-generator/tree/main/","readme":"# ui5-task-dts-generator\n\nTask for [ui5-builder](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-builder) which generates d.ts files (TypeScript type declaration file).\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-task-dts-generator --save-dev\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n1.

This extension is not intended to replace ui5 cli, its main objective is to provide a fast and global workspace configuration to work with multi root workspaces and projects deployed to on premise systems (Gateway).\n\n## Examples\n\n> You can find examples of vscode workspace configuration in [this repository](https://github.com/CarlosOrozco88/ui5-tools-examples).\n\n## Features\n\n---\n\n### ui5-tools\n\n- **Automatic less builder**. Looks for `styles.less` and `PROJECTFOLDER.less`\n- **Automatic themes builder**. Build `library.source.less` themes\n- **Configurator** commands for odata proxy, resources proxy and replace strings\n\n#### Server\n\n- **Handles AppCachebuster** in localhost (by default only in PROD mode).\n- Configurable **proxy** to one o multiple **odata service** (Gateway, Other, None). Command `alt+c alt+o`\n- Supports `.env` file for odata service authentication. `UI5TOOLS_ODATA_USER - UI5TOOLS_ODATA_PASSWORD`, `UI5TOOLS_ODATA_USER_2 - UI5TOOLS_ODATA_PASSWORD_2`, etc.\n- Configurable **proxy** to **resources** (Gateway, CDN SAPUI5, CDN OpenUI5, Local Runtime, None). Command `alt+c alt+u`\n- Configurable UI5 version (when using gateway proxy, extension will detect sapui5 version automatically)\n- **Live reload browser**, css and images hot reload\n- **Typescript** support (ESM)\n- **Built in localhost home** page server, with apps launchpad, readme.md, docs (md files), links, server info...\n- **Built in launchpad** for resources: Gateway, CDN SAPUI5 and Runtime. Configurable with file `fioriSandboxConfig.json`\n- Server uses **folder hierarchy**. For product apps and Z apps, is possible to emulate gateway bsp paths\n- Start server in **development mode** `alt+s alt+s` or **production mode** `alt+s alt+p` (launches `appFolder/libraryFolder` or `distFolder` folder of each project)\n- Multiple comands: start `alt+s alt+s`, restart `alt+s alt+r`... (check commands secction)\n\n#### Builder\n\n- **Component-preload.js**, checking configured ui5 version for correct build. Build your project by doing right click in project folder or `alt+b alt+b` and select project\n- **Dbg** files creation\n- **Typescript** support (ESM)\n- **Build less** files (looks for `styles.css`, `PROJECTFOLDERNAME.less` or library.source.less)\n- **Uglify** files\n- **Replace strings**\n- Build one project `alt+b alt+b` or all apps `alt+b alt+a` in one command\n- Building preload (Component-preload and library-preload) process uses [openui5-preload](https://github.com/r-murphy/openui5-preload)\n- Building theme (library.source.less) process uses [less-openui5](https://github.com/SAP/less-openui5)\n- Building styles (styles.less and PROJECTFOLDER.less) process uses [less](https://github.com/less/less.js)\n\n#### Deployer\n\n- **Gateway deploy**, process includes build process. Deploy your project doing right click in project folder or `alt+d alt+d` and select project\n- **ui5-tools.json** file located at project folder, with deployment configuration: [ui5-tools.json example](workspaceExample/Z_APP1/ui5-tools.json)\n- **Create, update and save** last order in ui5-tools.json file (configurable)\n- **Autoprefix** BSP name in order text while creation (optional)\n- Supports `.env` file for gateway authentication. `UI5TOOLS_DEPLOY_USER - UI5TOOLS_DEPLOY_PASSWORD`\n- Deploy process uses [ui5-nwabap-deployer-core\n  ](https://github.com/pfefferf/ui5-nwabap-deployer/blob/master/packages/ui5-nwabap-deployer-core), so the extension uses the same configuration in file ui5-tools.json (property deployer.options)\n\n### String replacer\n\n- **Default replace patterns** `<% TIMESTAMP %>`, `<% ISODATE %>`, `<% DMY %>`, `<% YMD %>`, `<% MYD %>`\n- **Create custom replacements** like `<% CUSTOMKEY %>` in workspace environment (configurable with command `alt+c alt+r`)\n- **Computed values** `COMPUTED_DATE_TIMESTAMP`, `COMPUTED_DATE_ISO`, `COMPUTED_DATE_DMY`, `COMPUTED_DATE_YMD`, `COMPUTED_DATE_MYD` and the special value `COMPUTED_DATE_FORMATTED`\n- **Suports custom computed date format**, replacements using dayjs during the build process:\n\n```json\n\"ui5-tools.builder.replaceKeysValues\": [\n  {\n    \"key\": \"DATE_FORMATED_EXAMPLE\",\n    \"value\": \"COMPUTED_DATE_FORMAT\",\n    \"param\": \"DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm:SS\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## Settings\n\n---\n\n#### General Settings\n\n- `ui5-tools.appSrcFolder`: Source folder for applications (ts) | default: `src`\n- `ui5-tools.appFolder`: Transpiled folder for applications (js) | default: `webapp`\n- `ui5-tools.librarySrcFolder`: Source folder for libraries (ts) | default: `src`\n- `ui5-tools.libraryFolder`: Transpiled folder for libraries (js) | default: `src-gen`\n- `ui5-tools.distFolder`: Destination folder in your project (final build) | default: `dist`\n- `ui5-tools.ui5Version`: UI5 library version for CDN proxy in server and build correct preload files: `1.71.42`\n\n#### Server Settings\n\n- `ui5-tools.server.name`: Server name | default: `UI5 Server`\n- `ui5-tools.server.port`: Set custom port of UI5 Server | default: `3000`\n- `ui5-tools.server.startOnLaunch`: Start server at launch vscode | default: `false`\n- `ui5-tools.server.openBrowser`: Open browser al launch server | default: `true`\n- `ui5-tools.server.watch`: Activate live reload | default: `true`\n- `ui5-tools.server.timeout`: Server timeout (ms), 0 for disable timeout | default: `60000`\n- `ui5-tools.server.watchExtensions`: Extensions to listen for live reload | default: `css,js,json,xml,html,properties`\n- `ui5-tools.server.protocol`: Should use http or https | default: `http`\n- `ui5-tools.server.odataProxy`: Proxy all odata calls to a server | default: `None`\n- `ui5-tools.server.odataUri`: Your odata server uri url (example: `http://srvaspgwd.com:8080/`). odataProxy `Other` accepts multiple uris (example: `http://srvaspgwd.com:8080/, http://srvaspgwd.com:8080/`)\n- `ui5-tools.server.odataSecure`: Verify odataProxy SSL Certs | default: `false`\n- `ui5-tools.server.odataMountPath`: The mountpath for 'Other' odataProxy.

@sap-ux/ui5-middleware-fe-mockserver\n\n## Features\n\nThe **SAP Fiori - UI5 middleware for the Fiori elements mock server** is a middleware extension for the [UI5 Tooling](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling). As an alternative to proxying OData requests to a live backend, it supports loading mock data for OData v2/v4 requests for supported Fiori elements templates. As the mock server runs locally without requiring a network connection to a backend system, it is useful for development and test scenarios.\n\n## Installation\nnpm\n`npm install --save-dev @sap-ux/ui5-middleware-fe-mockserver`\n\nyarn\n`yarn add @sap-ux/ui5-middleware-fe-mockserver --dev`\n\npnpm\n`pnpm add @sap-ux/ui5-middleware-fe-mockserver --dev`\n\n## Usage\n\nIn order to use the mock server, the npm module `@sap/ux-ui5-fe-mockserver-middleware` needs to be added as devDependency and ui5.dependencies to `package.json`, and a valid `ui5.yaml` configuration needs to be provided.\n**Entries in package.json**\n\n```\n[..]\n\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@sap-ux/ui5-middleware-fe-mockserver\": \"^1\"\n},\n\"ui5\": {\n    \"dependencies\": [\n        \"@sap-ux/ui5-middleware-fe-mockserver\"\n    ]\n}\n\n[..]\n```\n\n**Example for a yaml configuration file**\n\n```\n\nspecVersion: '2.0'\nmetadata:\n  name: <NAME>\ntype: application\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: sap-fe-mockserver\n      mountPath: /\n      afterMiddleware: compression\n      configuration:\n        annotations:\n          - localPath: './webapp/localService/myServiceAnnotation.xml'\n            urlPath: '/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/Annotations*'\n        services:\n          - urlPath: '/sap/opu/odata/sap/<SERVICE_NAME>'\n            metadataPath: './webapp/localService/metadata.xml'\n            mockdataPath: './webapp/localService/data'\n          - urlPath: '/sap/opu/odata/sap/<OTHER_SERVICE_NAME>'\n            metadataPath: './webapp/localService/other_metadata.xml'\n            mockdataPath: './webapp/localService/data'\n\n```\n\n\n## Service Configuration\n\nEach service must provide at least two things\n\n- urlPath : where will your service be accessible from\n- metadataPath : local path to your metadata file\n\nOn top of that you can specify one of the following option\n\n- mockdataPath : the path to the folder containing the mockdata files\n- generateMockData : whether or not you want to use automatically generated mockdata\n\nAdditional option are available either per service of for all services if defined globally\n\n- debug : toggle the debug mode\n- watch : toggle the watch mode, the mockserver will restart the service where data or metadata have changed\n- noETag : disable ETag support on metadata\n- strictKeyMode : disable the default \"loose\" mode for the key matching, you can try this if the mockserver returns too much data\n- contextBasedIsolation : enable the support of \"tenants\", by adding /tenant-xxx at the very start of your service call you will be able to work on tenant isolated data.\n\nYou can also define static annotation file using the `annotations` entry, each annotation must provide\n\n- urlPath : where will your annotation be accessible from\n- localPath : local path to your annotation file\n\n**Sample application**\n\nSee the usage in demo apps [SAP Fiori sample apps](https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-tools-samples)\n\n## Support\n\nJoin the [SAP Fiori tools Community](https://community.sap.com/search/?by=updated&ct=blog&mt=73555000100800002345).

 `@sap-ux/backend-proxy-middleware`\n\nThe `@sap-ux/backend-proxy-middleware` is a [Custom UI5 Server Middleware](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/extensibility/CustomServerMiddleware) for proxying requests to backend servers. The middleware is agnostic to running in local environments and SAP Business Application Studio. Additionally, if credentials are maintained with the SAP Fiori tools then these will be used.\n\nIt can be used either with the `ui5 serve` or the `fiori run` commands.\n\n## Configuration Options\n\n### `backend`\n| Option        | Type | Description |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ----------- |\n| `url`         | `string` mandatory (local)  | Mandatory URL pointing to the backend system. *Not required if destination is provided and the proxy is running SAP Business Application Studio |\n| `destination` | `string` mandatory (if no url) | Required if the backend system is available as destination in SAP Business Application Studio. |\n| `destinationInstance` | `string` optional | If a destination needs to be read by a specific instance of a destination service then you need to provide the id of the service as optional property `destinationInstance`.|\n| `path`        | `string` mandatory     | Path that is to be proxied |\n| `pathReplace`  | `string` optional      | If provided then the path will be replaced with this value before forwarding |\n| `client`      | `string` optional      | sap-client parameter |\n| `scp`         | `boolean` optional      | If set to true the proxy will execute the required OAuth routine for the ABAP environment on SAP BTP |\n| `apiHub`      | `boolean` optional      | If set to true then the proxy will connect to the SAP API Business Hub\n| `proxy`       | `string` optional      | If set then it will override the proxy settings from node.\n\nAdditional optional experimental property `bsp` (type `string`): The BSP property is only needed for the FLP Embedded Flow. The property refers to the BSP Application Name. In that case, we need to redirect the manifest.appdescr request to the local manifest.json in order to overwrite the deployed application with the local one.\n\n### `options`\nOptional object that can be used to directly set options of the used `http-proxy-middleware` modules (https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-proxy-middleware#http-proxy-middleware-options). Note: only declarative options (i.e. no functions) are supported.\n\n## Configuration Examples\n\n### [Connecting to a backend system](#connecting-to-a-backend-system)\n\nExecuting `ui5 serve` in your project with the configuration below in the `ui5.yaml` file would forward any request starting with the `path` parameter to the provided backend `url`.\n\n```\n- name: backend-proxy-middleware\n  afterMiddleware: compression\n  configuration:\n    backend:\n      path: /sap\n      url: https://my.backend.example:1234\n```\n\n### [Connecting to a backend system with destination](#connecting-to-a-backend-system-with-destination)\n\nIf working in SAP Business Application Studio and the backend is configured as destination then you can also provide the `destination` in the configuration. \nIf a destination needs to be read by a specific instance of a destination service then you need to provide the id of the service as optional property `destinationInstance`.\n\n```\n- name: backend-proxy-middleware\n  afterMiddleware: compression\n  configuration:\n    backend:\n      path: /sap\n      destination: my_example_destination\n```\n\n### [Connecting to a backend system with destination and principal propagation](#connecting-to-a-backend-system-with-destination-and-principal-propagation)\n\nIf the backend destination is configured to use principal propagation, then in some cases the requests might fail. If this occurs then you will need to set the optional property `xfwd` to `true`. This will add the x-forwared headers to the proxy requests.\n\n```\n- name: backend-proxy-middleware\n  afterMiddleware: compression\n  configuration:\n    backend:\n      path: /sap\n      destination: my_example_destination\n    options:\n      xfwd: true\n```\n\n### [Connecting to the SAP Business Technology Platform](#connecting-to-the-sap-business-technology-platform)\nIf you want to connect to an ABAP Environment on SAP Business Technology Platform then you will need to set the optional property `scp` to `true`. For any other target, remove this property or set it to `false`.\n\n```\n- name: backend-proxy-middleware\n  afterMiddleware: compression\n  configuration:\n    backend:\n      path: /sap\n      url: https://my.steampunk.example:1234\n      scp: true\n```\n\n### [Connecting to the SAP API Business Hub](#connecting-to-the-sap-api-business-hub)\nIf you want to connect to the SAP API Business Hub then you will need to set the optional property `apiHub` to `true`, and set the corresponding `path` and `url`, e.g.\n\n```\n- name: backend-proxy-middleware\n  afterMiddleware: compression\n  configuration:\n    backend:\n      path: /s4hanacloud\n      url: https://api.sap.com\n      apiHub: true\n```\n\n### [Proxying WebSockets](#proxying-websockets)\nIf you want the proxy to handle also WebSockets, then you need to set the optional property `ws` to `true`, e.g.\n\n```\n- name: backend-proxy-middleware\n  afterMiddleware: compression\n  configuration:\n    backend:\n      path: /sap\n      url: https://my.backend.example:1234\n    options:\n      ws: true\n```\n\n### [Changing the path to which a request is proxied](#changing-the-path-to-which-a-request-is-proxied)\nIf you want to configure the proxy to send requests from a certain path `/services/odata` to your backend (local url or destination) with a specified entry path `/my/entry/path`. Then you need to do the following:\n\n```\n- name: backend-proxy-middleware\n  afterMiddleware: compression\n  configuration:\n    backend:\n    - path: /services/odata\n      pathReplace: /my/entry/path\n      url: https://my.backend.example:1234\n      destination: my_example_destination\n```\n\n### [Providing Proxy Configuration](#providing-proxy-configuration)\nBy default the `backend-proxy-middleware` will read the proxy configuration from the Node.js environment variables `proxy`, `https-proxy` and `noproxy`. If those variables are not set, then you can also provide the proxy configuration in the `ui5.yaml` file. \n**Please note: if you want to exclude any domains from the proxy then you will need to set the `noproxy` variable, e.g. `npm config set noproxy \"sap.com\"`**.\n\n```\n- name: backend-proxy-middleware\n  afterMiddleware: compression\n  configuration:\n    proxy: https://myproxy.example:8443\n    backend:\n    - path: /sap\n      url: https://my.backend.example:1234\n\n```\n## Programmatic Usage\nAlternatively you can only use the underlying proxy function, e.g. for the case when you want to use the `backend-proxy-middleware` functionality in your `express` server.\n\n```Typescript\nimport { createProxy } from '@sap-ux/backend-proxy-middleware';\nconst proxy = createProxy(backend, options);\n```\n- **config** - The backend configuration\n- **options** - Options of the [http-proxy-middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-proxy-middleware#options)\n\n## Keywords\n* Backend Proxy Middleware\n* Fiori tools\n* Fiori elements\n* SAP

 `@sap-ux/ui5-proxy-middleware`\n\nThe `@sap-ux/ui5-proxy-middleware` is a [Custom UI5 Server Middleware](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/extensibility/CustomServerMiddleware) for loading the UI5 sources in your application. It can be used either with the `ui5 serve` or the `fiori run` commands.\n\n## Configuration Options\n| Option       | Default Value | Description |\n| ------------ | ------------- | ----------- |\n| `ui5`        | mandatory     | List of mount paths and target urls that should be handled by the proxy |\n| `version`    | `undefined`   | The UI5 version. If this property is not defined, then the `minUI5Version` from the `manifest.json` will be used |\n| `secure`     | true          | Defines if SSL certs should be verified |\n| `debug`      | false         | Enables debug output |\n| `proxy`      | `undefined`   | Use for adding corporate proxy configuration |\n| `directLoad` | false         | Defines whether the UI5 sources should be loaded directly from UI5 CDN |\n\n## Usage\nIn order to use the middleware this is the minimal configuration that you need to provide in the `ui5.yaml` of your application.\n\n```Yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-proxy-middleware\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      ui5:\n      - path: /resources\n        url: https://ui5.sap.com\n      - path: /test-resources\n        url: https://ui5.sap.com\n```\n\nAlternatively you can use the following syntax if all paths should be proxied to the same url.\n\n```Yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-proxy-middleware\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      ui5:\n        path: \n        - /resources\n        - /test-resources\n        url: https://ui5.sap.com\n```\n**NOTE: You can't mix both syntaxes!**\n\nFinally don't forget to add the following in your `package.json`.\n\n```JSON\n\"ui5\": {\n    \"dependencies\": [\n        \"@sap-ux/ui5-proxy-middleware\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n## Examples\n### Loading a specific UI5 version\nTo load a specific a UI5 version in your application you can use the `version` parameter, e.g.\n\n```Yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-proxy-middleware\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      ui5:\n      - path: /resources\n        url: https://ui5.sap.com\n      - path: /test-resources\n        url: https://ui5.sap.com\n      version: 1.96.1\n```\n\n### Loading UI5 sources directly from UI5 CDN\nIf you don't load all UI5 source through the `ui5-proxy-middleware`, then you can set `directLoad: true`. This will inject the absolute UI5 URL in the bootstrap of your HTML file, thus loading the libraries directly from UI5 CDN.\n\n**NOTE: this works only for the default HTML files created by the [Fiori generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/generator-fiori) when a project is generated. Hence index.html, flpSandbox.html and flpSandboxMockServer.html!**\n\n```Yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-proxy-middleware\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      ui5:\n      - path: /resources\n        url: https://ui5.sap.com\n      - path: /test-resources\n        url: https://ui5.sap.com\n      directLoad: true\n```\n\n### Adding corporate proxy configuration\nIf you are behind a corporate proxy then you can provide your corporate proxy configuration as follows.\n\n```Yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-proxy-middleware\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      ui5:\n      - path: /resources\n        url: https://ui5.sap.com\n      - path: /test-resources\n        url: https://ui5.sap.com\n      proxy: https://my.corporate.proxy.example\n```\n\n## Programmatic Usage\nAlternatively you can only use the underlying proxy function, e.g. for the case when you want to incorporate the `ui5-proxy-middleware` functionality in your own middleware.\n\n```Typescript\nimport { ui5Proxy } from '@sap-ux/ui5-proxy-middleware';\nconst ui5ProxyMiddlewareFn = ui5Proxy(config, options, filter)\n```\n- **config** - The UI5 configuration\n- **options** - Options of the [http-proxy-middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-proxy-middleware#options)\n- **filter** - a custom function to determine which requests should be proxied or not, [example](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-proxy-middleware#context-matching)\n\n## Keywords\nUI5 Proxy

Tooling](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling).\n\n[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP/openui5-sample-app)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP/openui5-sample-app)\n\n## Prerequisites\n- The **UI5 CLI** of the [UI5 Tooling](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling#installing-the-ui5-cli).\n    - For installation instructions please see: [Installing the UI5 CLI](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling#installing-the-ui5-cli).\n\n## Getting started\n1. Clone this repository and navigate into it\n    ```sh\n    git clone https://github.com/SAP/openui5-sample-app.git\n    cd openui5-sample-app\n    ```\n1. Install all dependencies\n    ```sh\n    npm install\n    ```\n\n1. Start a local server and run the application (http://localhost:8080/index.html)\n    ```sh\n    ui5 serve -o index.html\n    ```\n\n## Testing\n* Run [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) code validation\n    ```sh\n    npm run lint\n    ```\n* Start the [Karma Test Runner](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html) with the [UI5 Plugin](https://github.com/SAP/karma-ui5) and execute the tests automatically after every change\n    ```sh\n    npm run watch\n    ```\n* Run both ESLint and Karma in CI mode\n    ```sh\n    npm test\n    ```\n## Building\n### Option 1: Standard preload build\n1. Execute the build\n    ```sh\n    ui5 build -a\n    ```\n1. Run the result\n    1. Run a local HTTP server on the build results (`/dist` directory)  \n\t(**Note:** This script is using the [local-web-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/local-web-server) npm module, but you can use any HTTP server for that)\n        ```sh\n        npm run serve-dist\n        ```\n    1. Open the app at http://localhost:8000\n\n### Option 2: Self-contained build\n1. (Optional) Remove previous build results\n   ```sh\n   rm -rf ./dist\n   ```\n1. Execute the `self-contained` build to create a bundle with all of your applications runtime dependencies\n    ```sh\n    ui5 build self-contained -a\n    ```\n1. Run the result\n    1. Run a local HTTP server on the build results (`/dist` directory)  \n\t(**Note:** This script is using the [local-web-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/local-web-server) npm module, but you can use any HTTP server for that)\n        ```sh\n        npm run serve-dist\n        ```\n    1. Open the app at http://localhost:8000\n\n## Working with local dependencies\n\nFor local development of your applications' dependencies (like OpenUI5 libraries) you can link them by using Yarn. This will allow you to make changes to your applications dependencies locally and see the impact in your application immediately.\n\n**Note:** Currently only Yarn understands the [workspace](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) package setting used in the OpenUI5 repository. If you do not plan to work with OpenUI5 you might as well use npm. But keep in mind that linking the same module with npm and Yarn might lead to issues. Also, Yarn can't work with links created by npm and vice versa. See [FAQ: What's the thing with yarn?](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/FAQ/#whats-the-thing-with-yarn) for details.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (**version must be 1.x**)\n    - *Note that you can use npm instead of Yarn if you do not plan to work with a local copy of the [OpenUI5 main repository](https://github.com/SAP/openui5). See [FAQ: What's the thing with yarn?](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling#whats-the-thing-with-yarn)*\n\n### Preparation\nThe following needs to be done just once per setup.\n\n1. Clone the OpenUI5 repository and navigate into it\n    **Note:** The UI5 version must be 1.65.0 or higher, you can check that in the root `package.json` file\n    ```sh\n    git clone https://github.com/SAP/openui5.git\n    cd openui5\n    ```\n1. Install all dependencies (this also links all OpenUI5 libraries between each other)\n    ```sh\n    yarn\n    ```\n1. Make all projects available as global links. **Note**: The OpenUI5 project uses [wsrun](https://github.com/whoeverest/wsrun) to link all libraries with one command. See [Linking Projects](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/Overview/#linking-projects) for general information about project linking.  \n    In the OpenUI5 root directory, execute:\n    ```sh\n    yarn run link-all\n    ```\n2. The UI5 Tooling currently does not support linking of framework libraries defined in the `ui5.yaml` (see [[RFC] 0006 Local Dependency Resolution](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling/pull/157)). Therefore you need to first remove them from there. Instead, you need to add the dependencies via Yarn, so that they can be linked in the next step.  \n\tIn the application directory, execute:\n    ```sh\n    ui5 remove sap.f sap.m sap.ui.core themelib_sap_fiori_3\n    ```\n    ```sh\n    yarn add @openui5/sap.f\n    yarn add @openui5/sap.m\n    yarn add @openui5/sap.ui.core\n    yarn add @openui5/themelib_sap_fiori_3\n    ```\n\n### Linking\n1. In your application directory: Link the required OpenUI5 libraries\n    ```sh\n    yarn link @openui5/sap.f\n    yarn link @openui5/sap.m\n    yarn link @openui5/sap.ui.core\n    yarn link @openui5/themelib_sap_fiori_3\n    ```\n\nYou can now make changes in your local OpenUI5 repository and see the impact directly when serving or building your application.\n\n### Unlinking\nTo return to using the OpenUI5 npm packages\n\n1. Remove the dependencies via Yarn\n    ```sh\n    yarn remove @openui5/sap.f\n    yarn remove @openui5/sap.m\n    yarn remove @openui5/sap.ui.core\n    yarn remove @openui5/themelib_sap_fiori_3\n    ```\n2. Re-add the libraries to the framework section of the `ui5.yaml`\n    ```sh\n    ui5 add sap.f sap.m sap.ui.core themelib_sap_fiori_3\n    ```\n","downloadsCurrentMonth":-1,"downloadsCurrentFortnight":-1,"downloads365":-1},{"name":"ui5-typescript-helloworld","version":"1.0.0","description":"Showcase of a TypeScript setup for developing UI5 applications","author":"SAP SE","license":"apache-2.0","scripts":{"build":"npm-run-all build:ts build:ui5","build:opt":"npm-run-all build:ts build:ui5:opt","build:ts":"babel src --out-dir webapp --source-maps true --extensions \".ts,.js\" --copy-files","build:ui5":"ui5 build --clean-dest","build:ui5:opt":"ui5 build self-contained --clean-dest --all","start":"npm-run-all --parallel watch:ts start:ui5","watch:ts":"babel src --out-dir webapp --source-maps true --extensions \".ts,.js\" --copy-files --watch","start:ui5":"ui5 serve --port 8080 -o index.html","start:dist":"ui5 serve  --port 8080 -o index.html --config ui5-dist.yaml","ts-typecheck":"tsc --noEmit","lint":"eslint src"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-helloworld.git"},"devDependencies":{"@babel/cli":"^7.18.6","@babel/core":"^7.18.6","@babel/preset-env":"^7.18.6","@babel/preset-typescript":"^7.18.6","@types/openui5":"1.104.0","@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin":"^5.30.6","@typescript-eslint/parser":"^5.30.6","@ui5/cli":"^2.14.9","babel-preset-transform-ui5":"^7.0.5","eslint":"^8.20.0","npm-run-all":"^4.1.5","typescript":"^4.7.4","ui5-middleware-livereload":"^0.5.13"},"ui5":{"dependencies":["ui5-middleware-livereload"]},"type":"application","tags":["sample","SAP"],"liveDemoUrl":"https://ui5-typescript-helloworld.bestofui5.org/","gitHubOwner":"SAP-samples","gitHubRepo":"ui5-typescript-helloworld","licenseSource":"apache-2.0","forks":10,"stars":42,"addedToBoUI5":"2022-06-17T12:47:58.868Z","createdAt":"2021-06-03T18:50:17Z","updatedAt":"2022-08-01T11:53:05Z","vscodeInstalls":-1,"sourceType":"application","githublink":"https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-helloworld/tree/main/","readme":"# A Small TypeScript UI5 Example App\n\n[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-helloworld)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-helloworld)\n\n## Description\n\nThis app demonstrates a TypeScript setup for developing UI5 applications.\n\nAs the focus is on the TypeScript setup, the app code itself is quite minimal, it is not using models, translation files etc.\n\n<b>This repository also contains [a detailed step-by-step guide](step-by-step.md), which explains how this setup is created and how all the bits and pieces fit together.</b>\n\n<b>In the [custom-controls](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-helloworld/tree/custom-controls) branch, this repository also contains instructions and an example how custom controls can be developed in TypeScript within applications.</b>\n\n<b>The [TypeScript branch of the \"UI5 CAP Event App\"](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-cap-event-app/tree/typescript) sample demonstrates a slightly more complex application, using the same setup. It comes with an [explanation](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-cap-event-app/blob/typescript/docs/typescript.md) of what UI5 TypeScript code usually looks like and what to consider.</b>\n\n<b>The UI5con 2021 session on TypeScript ([recording available at YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXzcsOZH4q8)) explains the overall approach for TypeScript and UI5.</b>\n\n<b>There is also an [application template](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-ts-app) (based on yeoman and easy-ui5) which has been shown in the [UI5con Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXzcsOZH4q8) and explained in [this blog](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/07/01/getting-started-with-typescript-for-ui5-application-development/).</b>\n\n| :point_up: Overview of TypeScript-related Entities |\n|:---------------------------|\n| The UI5 type definitions (`*.d.ts` files) are loaded as dev dependency from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openui5/ts-types-esm). They are a work in progress, so while they should be working well already, we are still improving them, which might also lead to breaking changes.<br/>\n The file [tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json) contains the configuration for the TypeScript compilation, including a reference to the UI5 `*.d.ts` files.<br/>\n Normally, the UI5 JavaScript files (controllers, Component.js etc.) would reside in the `webapp` folder. Now they are in the [src](src) folder. The TypeScript compilation will create the `webapp` folder and put all output there. <br/>\n In addition to the TypeScript compilation, there is also a conversion from the ES6 module and class syntax used in the source files to the classic UI5 module loading and class definition syntax (`sap.ui.define(...)` and `superClass.extend(...)`). This conversion is using the [babel-plugin-transform-modules-ui5](https://github.com/r-murphy/babel-plugin-transform-modules-ui5) project from Ryan Murphy. <br/> \n Both, the TypeScript compilation and the ES6 syntax transformation, are executed by Babel, as configured in the file [.babelrc.json](.babelrc.json)<br/> \n This combined transformation is triggered by both the `build:ts` and `watch:ts` scripts in [package.json](package.json). |\n\n\n\n## Requirements\n\nEither [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for dependency management.\n\n## Download and Installation\n\n1. Clone the project:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-helloworld.git\ncd ui5-typescript-helloworld\n```\n    \n(or download from https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-helloworld/archive/main.zip)\n\n2. Use npm (or yarn) to install the dependencies:\n\n```sh\nnpm i\n```\n\n(To use yarn, just do `yarn` instead.)\n\n## Run the App\n\nExecute the following command to run the app locally for development in watch mode (the browser reloads the app automatically when there are changes in the source code):\n\n```sh\nnpm start\n```\n\nAs shown in the terminal after executing this command, the app is then running on http://localhost:8080/index.html. A browser window with this URL should automatically open.\n\n(When using yarn, do `yarn start` instead.)\n\n\n## Debug the App\n\nIn the browser, you can directly debug the original TypeScript code, which is supplied via sourcemaps (need to be enabled in the browser's developer console if it does not work straight away). If the browser doesn't automatically jump to the TypeScript code when setting breakpoints, use e.g. `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `P` in Chrome to open the `*.ts` file you want to debug.\n\n\n## Build the App\n\n### Unoptimized (but quick)\nExecute the following command to build the project and get an app that can be deployed:\n\n```sh\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThe result is placed into the `dist` folder. To start the generated package, just run\n\n```sh\nnpm run start:dist\n```\n\nNote that `index.html` still loads the UI5 framework from the relative URL `resources/...`, which does not physically exist, but is only provided dynamically by the UI5 tooling. So for an actual deployment you should change this URL to either [the CDN](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/2d3eb2f322ea4a82983c1c62a33ec4ae) or your local deployment of UI5.\n\n(When using yarn, do `yarn build` and `yarn start:dist` instead.)\n\n\n### Optimized\n\nFor an optimized self-contained build (takes longer because the UI5 resources are built, too), do:\n\n```sh\nnpm run build:opt\n```\n\nTo start the generated package, again just run \n\n```sh\nnpm run start:dist\n```\n\nIn this case, all UI5 framework resources are also available within the `dist` folder, so the folder can be deployed as-is to any static web server, without changing the bootstrap URL.<br>\nWith the self-contained build, the bootstrap URL in `index.html` has already been modified to load the newly created `sap-ui-custom.js` for bootstrapping, which contains all app resources as well as all needed UI5 JavaScript resources. Most UI5 resources inside the `dist` folder are for this reason actually <emph>not</emph> needed to run the app. Only the non-JS-files, like translation texts and CSS files, are used and must also be deployed. (Only when for some reason JS files are missing from the optimized self-contained bundle, they are also loaded separately.)\n\n(When using yarn, do `yarn build:opt` and `yarn start:dist` instead.)\n\n\n## Check the Code\n\nDo the following to run a TypeScript check:\n\n```sh\nnpm run ts-typecheck\n```\n\nThis checks the application code for any type errors (but will also complain in case of fundamental syntax issues which break the parsing).<br>\n\n\nTo lint the TypeScript code, do:\n\n```sh\nnpm run lint\n```\n\n(Again, when using yarn, do `yarn ts-typecheck` and `yarn lint` instead.)\n\n## Limitations\n\n- At this time, the used eslint rules are not verified to be optimal or to be in sync with UI5 recommendations.\n\n\n## Known Issues\n\nNone.\n\n\n## How to Obtain Support\n\nThe sample code is provided **as-is**. No support is provided.\n\n[Create an issue](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-helloworld/issues) in this repository if you find a bug.\nQuestions can be [asked in SAP Community](https://answers.sap.com/questions/ask.html).\n\n<!-- ## Contributing -->\n\n\n## References\n\nOnce you have understood the setup and want to inspect the code of a slightly more comprehensive UI5 app written in TypeScript, you can check out the [TypeScript version of the UI5 CAP Event App Sample](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-cap-event-app/tree/typescript).\n\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2021 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.

It explains how this setup is created and how all the bits and pieces fit together**\n\n| :point_up: Overview of TypeScript-related Entities |\n|:---------------------------|\n| The UI5 type definitions (`*.d.ts` files) are loaded as dev dependency from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openui5/ts-types-esm). They are work in progress, so while they should be working well already, we are still improving them, which might also lead to breaking changes. |\n| The file [tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json) contains the configuration for the TypeScript compilation, including a reference to these UI5 `*.d.ts` files. |\n| Normally, the UI5 JavaScript files (controllers, Component.js etc.) would reside in the `webapp` folder. Now they are in the [src](src) folder. The TypeScript compilation will create the `webapp` folder and put all output there. |\n| In addition to the TypeScript compilation, there is also a conversion from the ES6 module and class syntax used in the source files to the classic UI5 module loading and class definition syntax (`sap.ui.define(...)` and `superClass.extend(...)`). This conversion is using the [babel-plugin-transform-modules-ui5](https://github.com/r-murphy/babel-plugin-transform-modules-ui5) project from Ryan Murphy. |\n| Both, the TypeScript compilation and the ES6 syntax transformation, are executed by Babel, as configured in the file [.babelrc.json](.babelrc.json) |\n| This combined transformation is triggered by both the `build:ts` and `watch:ts` scripts in [package.json](package.json). |\n\n## Project setup\nPNPM as package manager for monorepo\n\nSeparate packages for:\n - UI5 application: packages/ui/\n - UI5 library: packages/library/\n - CAP server: packages/server/\n\nCAP server is proxied by UI5 application\n\nUI5 application depends on the UI5 library project which is consumed as regular dependency\n\n![Project setup Image](./images/project.png)\n\n## UI setup\nThis UI app demonstrates on how to get the most out of TypeScript using classes, generic types and much more. This is all explained in details in the following blog post: https://blogs.sap.com/2021/12/07/my-first-experience-with-typescript-in-ui5-classes-and-state-model-manager/\n\nThe app is separated in multiple layers:\n - Service layer which handles the communication to the backend\n - Data model layer which contains a virtual replication of the data model in the backend and handles everything related to the internal data model\n - View/controller will be dedicated to handle user interaction\n\n![UI setup image](./images/ui-structure.png)\n\n## UI Library\nMore information regarding custom UI5 Libraries and custom controls can be found here: https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-control-library\n\n## Testing\nThe end-to-end tests are done by using WDI5: https://github.com/ui5-community/wdi5\n\n## Requirements\n\n[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for dependency management.\n\n## Preparation\n\nUse `npm` to install the dependencies:\n\n```sh\nnpm i\n```\n\n## Run the App\n\nExecute the following command to run the app locally for development in watch mode (the browser reloads the app automatically when there are changes in the source code):\n\n```sh\nnpm start\n```\n\nAs shown in the terminal after executing this command, the app is then running on http://localhost:8080/index.html. A browser window with this URL should automatically open.\n\n## Debug the App\n\nIn the browser, you can directly debug the original TypeScript code, which is supplied via sourcemaps (need to be enabled in the browser's developer console if it does not work straight away). If the browser doesn't automatically jump to the TypeScript code when setting breakpoints, use e.g. Ctrl+P in Chrome to open the `*.ts` file you want to debug.\n\n## Build the App\n\nExecute the following command to build all packages at once:\n\n```sh\nnpm run build\n```\n\n## References\n\nOnce you have understood the setup and want to inspect the code of a slightly more comprehensive UI5 app written in TypeScript, you can check out the [TypeScript version of the UI5 CAP Event App Sample](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-cap-event-app/tree/typescript).\n\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the Apache Software License, version 2.0 except as noted otherwise in the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.\n","downloadsCurrentMonth":-1,"downloadsCurrentFortnight":-1,"downloads365":-1},{"name":"ui5-cc-dndashboard","description":"This package contains a UI5 Custom Control Library which enables the creation of Drag and Drop Dashboards in UI5.

ui5-middleware-destination\nCustom UI5 server middleware for projects using [UI5 Tooling](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling)\n* Provides proxy capabilities and support for `neo-app.json` routes\n* Works with destinations from destination files, as WebIDE does\n* Supports serving resources from local system or remote CDN (like the [SAPUI5 SDK](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com) or an ABAP application server)\n\n## Installation\n```bash\nnpm i --save-dev ui5-middleware-destination\n```\n\n## Pre-requisites\nCreate a directory to hold the destination files needed for your project -- preferably, out of your project's root so that the same config can be used for multiple projects. This also helps keeping your credentials from being committed.\n\nThis middleware will look in that directory for one (or many) json file(s) with a specific structure (check the [example json](templates/destinations.json)).\n\nAs an alternative, the middleware will also look for destination files in the created directory. The structure of these files is the same as the one used in [WebIDE destination files](https://help.sap.com/viewer/825270ffffe74d9f988a0f0066ad59f0/CF/en-US/2cf47f37e34c428c97a51057733c0394.html) (also check the [example template](templates/webide-destination)).\n\nFor the time being, the only properties required in a destination configuration are **`Name`, `URL`, `User`, `Password` and `WebIDEUsage`**.\n\n*NOTE: Storing passwords in plain text format ***is a potential security risk***. Please comply with your organization's policy.*\n\n\n## Options for SAPUI5 config in destinations file\n```jsonc\n{\n  \"Name\": \"sapui5\", // Name is used as an identifier\n  \"Description\": \"SAPUI5 Resources\",\n  \"URL\": \"C:\\\\Dev\\\\workspace\\\\sapui5\\\\sdk\", // Can be used to specify cdn URL e.g. https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/\n  \"preferLocal\": false // Flag to determine whether the resources files will be served from local system or cdn remote server\n}\n```\n\n## Usage\n### 1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`\n\n```jsonc\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-destination\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n},\n\"ui5\": {\n  \"dependencies\": [\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-destination\",\n    // ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> As the devDependencies are not recognized by the UI5 tooling, they need to be listed in the `ui5.dependencies` array. In addition, once using the `ui5.dependencies` array you need to list all UI5 tooling relevant dependencies.\n\n### 2. Configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`\n\n#### Simplest usage:\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-middleware-destination\n      afterMiddleware: cors\n      configuration:\n  \t    destinationsPath: '../path/to/destination/files'\n```\n\n#### Example config serving from CDN:\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-middleware-destination\n      afterMiddleware: cors\n      configuration:\n        debug: true\n        destinationsPath: '../path/to/destination/files'\n        resources:\n          preferLocal: false\n          path: 'https://path/to/CDN/resources'\n```\n\n#### Example config serving from an ABAP AS with self-signed certificate:\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-middleware-destination\n      afterMiddleware: cors\n      configuration:\n        debug: true\n        destinationsPath: '../path/to/destination/files'\n        resources:\n          preferLocal: false\n          path: 'https://<host>:<port>/path/to/ABAP/AS/resources'\n        strictSSL: false\n```\n\n#### Example config serving from local resources:\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-middleware-destination\n      afterMiddleware: cors\n      configuration:\n        destinationsPath: '../path/to/destination/files'\n        resources:\n          preferLocal: true\n          path: '../local/path/to/resources'\n```\n\n## Configuration options\n**ATTENTION:** No options are mandatory, EXCEPT for **`destinationsPath`**. This option **must** be provided either in the `ui5.yml` file or as an environment variable (as in the description below).\n\n> Note that relative paths declared in these options are resolved against the project's root.\n\n* **`debug`** *(boolean, default:* `false`*)*  \nEnables the logging of each request and where it is served from.\n\n* **`destinationsPath`** *(string)*  \nAbsolute or relative path to the [destination files](#pre-requisites).  \nIf a relative path is provided, it is resolved against the project's root folder.  \nIf you do not provide this option in the `ui5.yml` file, you **must** set the `UI5_MIDDLEWARE_DESTINATIONS_PATH` environment variable. \n\n* **`strictSSL`** *(boolean, default:* `true`*)*  \nWhen set to false, the proxy does not validate SSL certificates of the resource server.  \nThis covers the use case of, for example, serving routes from a corporate ABAP AS with a self-signed certificate.\n\n* **`resources`** *(object)*  \nOptions regarding SAPUI5 resources:\n\n  * **`path`** *(string)*  \n  If `preferLocal` is `true`, then this is the local absolute or relative path to SAPUI5 resources.  \n  When `preferLocal` is `false`, you can provide a CDN URL for the SAPUI5 resources. or [https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com) will be used as CDN source  \n  This option can be provided either in the `ui5.yml` file or through the `UI5_MIDDLEWARE_RESOURCES_PATH` environment variable.\n  \n  * **`preferLocal`** *(boolean, default:* `false`*)*  \n  When `true`, middleware redirects all the ui5 resources requests to local filesystem.\n  This option can be provided through `UI5_MIDDLEWARE_RESOURCES_LOCAL` environment variable. Possible values in environment variable can be `0` or `1`.\n\n## How it works\n* Integrates [node-http-proxy](https://github.com/http-party/node-http-proxy) to proxy requests to remote server using the [destination files](#pre-requisites).\n* Integrates [serve-static](https://github.com/expressjs/serve-static) to serve static resources from a local path.\n\n## Limitations\nCurrently only BasicAuthentication is supported.\n\n## Contribution Guidelines\nPull Request are welcome. However, if change is complex or huge, Please create an issue and have a discussion on the approach before developing something.\n\n## Contributors\n- [Preetam](https://github.com/preetamkajalrout)\n- [Leonardo](https://github.com/leo-ls)\n\n## LICENSE\nProject is distributed under [MIT License](LICENSE)","jsdoc":{},"downloadsCurrentMonth":12,"downloadsCurrentFortnight":2,"downloads365":791,"downloadsFortnightGrowth":-80,"downloadsHistory":[{"yearMonth":"2021-09","downloads":70},{"yearMonth":"2021-10","downloads":68},{"yearMonth":"2021-11","downloads":88},{"yearMonth":"2021-12","downloads":91},{"yearMonth":"2022-01","downloads":187},{"yearMonth":"2022-02","downloads":22},{"yearMonth":"2022-03","downloads":65},{"yearMonth":"2022-04","downloads":40},{"yearMonth":"2022-05","downloads":44},{"yearMonth":"2022-06","downloads":12},{"yearMonth":"2022-07","downloads":12}],"npmlink":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-destination","versions":[{"version":"created","date":"2019-09-22T17:42:49.316Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-destination/v/created","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"1.0.0","date":"2019-09-22T17:42:49.461Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-destination/v/1.0.0","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"modified","date":"2022-05-22T16:28:46.512Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-destination/v/modified","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"1.0.1","date":"2019-09-22T17:47:03.549Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-destination/v/1.0.1","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"1.0.2","date":"2019-09-22T18:14:11.879Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-destination/v/1.0.2","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"1.0.3","date":"2020-05-11T15:24:01.235Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-destination/v/1.0.3","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"1.1.1","date":"2020-07-19T23:03:39.618Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-destination/v/1.1.1","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"1.1.2","date":"2020-07-20T19:35:23.636Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-destination/v/1.1.2","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"2.0.1","date":"2020-07-21T09:59:59.129Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-destination/v/2.0.1","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"2.0.2","date":"2020-07-21T10:07:12.473Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-destination/v/2.0.2","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"}]},{"name":"bestofui5-website","version":"0.15.0","description":"bestofui5-website -

This is generated after each commit in `main` branch.  \n![Best Of UI5 Diagramm](img/BestOfUI5_Architecture.png)\n\n## Frontend\n\nThe frontend is generated with the [UI5-TS-App Generator](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-ts-app) and written completly in TypeScript.\nIn the folder `src` is the source code.\n\n### External Dependencies\n\nWe use two external modules (`ui5-cc-md` and `chart.js`) that are integrated in two different ways.\n\n#### `ui5-cc-md`\n\nFor each package we load the `README.md` to show it on the object page.  \nTo render this we use [`ui5-cc-md`](https://github.com/ui5-community/ui5-cc-md) integrated via NPM.  \nTo use this simply install `ui5-cc-md` and add `ui5-cc-md` to your `package.json` at [\"ui5\"-->\"dependencies\"](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-website/blob/5a33b4b710d8143f1d07195bba9ca28696871995/package.json#L77-L82).  \nNow we can use simply use this in the [`Object.view.xml`](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-website/blob/5a33b4b710d8143f1d07195bba9ca28696871995/src/view/Object.view.xml#L94) to render the markdown.\n\n#### `chart.js`\n\nWe also get the historical download data from all npm packages.  \nTo display this data we use [`chart.js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chart.js) in the in the `Object.view.xml`.  \nTo use this library install via NPM [`ui5-tooling-modules`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-tooling-modules) and `chart.js`.  \nAs template to integrate `chart.js` we use almost the same implementation from [@akudev](https://github.com/akudev) in this tutorial:\n[ui5-typescript-tutorial - Using NPM Packages](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-tutorial/tree/main/exercises/ex8)  \nFor a better usage we create a [custom control](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-website/blob/main/src/control/BarChart.ts) to use a bar chart.\nNow we can use this chart in the [`Object.view.xml#L61-L63`](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-website/blob/5a33b4b710d8143f1d07195bba9ca28696871995/src/view/Object.view.xml#L83-L85) to display the data.\n\n### UI5 Web Components\n\nEven though the [UI5 Web Components](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/) were originally intended for use outside of the UI5 framework, the components are now integrated into the OpenUI5 framework.  \nThey will replace the standard controls in the long run and therefore it makes sense to use them already.  \nAs a use case, we wanted to display the individual released versions of the NPM packages sorted by date.  \nIn [SAPUI5 there is a timeline](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.suite.ui.commons.Timeline) for this, but unfortunately not in OpenUI5, however in the [UI5 web components](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/playground/components/Timeline/) there is.  \nTo use the UI5 web components, [@petermuessig](https://github.com/petermuessig) has already written a [detailed blog](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/03/10/ui5-web-components-enablement-for-openui5-sapui5/) about it.  \nThrough direct integration with OpenUI5 the use is as simple as any other control [`Timeline.view.xml#L18-L37`](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-website/blob/5a33b4b710d8143f1d07195bba9ca28696871995/src/view/Timeline.view.xml#L18-L37)\n\n### Build & Deployment\n\nBuild is automated with GitHub Actions.  \nOn every push to `main`, the [`build`](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-website/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml) workflow is triggered.  \nThis will transpile typescript to javascript and run `ui5 build self-contained --all`.  \nThe result will be moved to the new folder [`docs`](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-website/tree/docs) and force pushed to the `docs` branch.  \nFrom there, GitHub Pages will automatically deploy the new version to the webpage <https://bestofui5.org/> .\n\n### Testing\n\nWe run [`wdi5`](https://github.com/js-soft/wdi5) tests on every Pull Request.  \nImplicitly, the build is also tested before the wdi5 tests, since it is executed before the tests.  \nThe tests are located in the [`test`](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-website/tree/main/src/test) folder.  \nWe run the tests with [mock data](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-website/tree/main/src/localService) to make sure we get consistent results on the tests.\n\n## Backend\n\n**The backend is located in a seperate repository [`bestofui5-data`](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-data#readme).**  \n**For a more detailed documentation read the readme there.**\n\nWe crawl data from GitHub and NPM.  \nThe source code is written in typescript and in folder [`src`](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-data/tree/main/src).\nIt creates two json files (`data`, `versions`) which will be used as a model in the UI5 App.  \nThe latest update of the files are located in the [`data`](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-data/tree/live-data/data) folder on the `live-data` branch.\nThe frontend is using these raw files [directly from the branch](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-website/blob/5a33b4b710d8143f1d07195bba9ca28696871995/src/manifest.json#L17-L27).  \nThe packages are crawled from are located in [`sources.json`](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-data/blob/main/sources.json).\n\n## DevOps\n\n### Deployment of Pull Requests to Azure Static Web Apps\n\nIn order for contributors to better understand the impact of a pull request and to better test it, there is an option to deploy the changes of a pull request into a test environment, using [Azure Static Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-en/services/app-service/static/#overview).  \nThis makes it easy to access and test the app.  \n**For security reasons, this only works for pull requests from the `ui5-community` repo.**\n\n#### How To\n\n- **Create**: To initiate the deployment to Azure Static Web Apps, the label `deploy_test` must be assigned to a pull request.  \n  - If this was successful, a comment is left in the pull request with the link to the app.  \n- **Update**: After the label is added, each commit initiates an update to the Azure Static Web App.\n  - If this label is not present on the pull request, the GitHub actions will be skipped every time.  \n- **Delete**: If the pull request is closed (manually or via merge), the Azure Static Web App is also deleted.\n  -  Do not remove the label, otherwise the app will not be deleted!\n\n## Run local\n\n### Requirements\n\nEither [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for dependency management.\n\ngit clone:\n`> git clone https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-website`\n\nInstall:\n`> npm install`\n\nStart UI5 App:\n`> npm start`\n\n## Changelog\n\nView the [Changelog here](CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the Apache Software License, version 2.0 except as noted otherwise in the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.\n\n","downloadsCurrentMonth":-1,"downloadsCurrentFortnight":-1,"downloads365":-1},{"name":"@capire/sflight","version":"1.0.0","private":true,"description":"CAP flight demo scenario","license":"apache-2.0","repository":"https://github.com/SAP-samples/cap-sflight","engines":{"node":">=14"},"scripts":{"lint":"npx eslint .","start":"cds run","test":"jest","test:mocha":"npx mocha --timeout 20000"},"dependencies":{"@sap/cds":">=5.4.5","@sap/xssec":"^3.2.7","express":"^4","hdb":"^0.19.1","passport":"^0.6.0"},"devDependencies":{"@sap/ux-specification":"^1.96.0","axios":"^0","chai":"^4.3.0","chai-as-promised":"^7.1.1","chai-subset":"^1.6.0","jest":"^28.1.0","qunit":"^2.9.3","sqlite3":"^5"},"cds":{"requires":{"db":{"kind":"sql"},"[production]":{"db":{"kind":"hana-cloud"},"auth":{"kind":"xsuaa"}},"[development]":{"auth":{"kind":"dummy-auth","users":{"rose":{"password":"rose","roles":[]},"martha":{"password":"martha","roles":["reviewer"]},"amy":{"password":"amy","roles":["processor"]}}}}},"log":{"service":true},"features":{"preserve_computed":true},"build":{"[node]":{"target":"gen","tasks":[{"for":"node-cf"},{"for":"hana"}]},"[java]":{"target":".","tasks":[{"for":"java-cf"}]},"[hana]":{"target":"gen","tasks":[{"for":"hana"}]}}},"jest":{"testEnvironment":"node","testTimeout":20000},"sapux":["app/travel_processor"],"type":"application","tags":["CAP","typescript","sample"],"liveDemoUrl":"https://cap-sflight.bestofui5.org/","gitHubOwner":"SAP-samples","gitHubRepo":"cap-sflight","licenseSource":"apache-2.0","forks":50,"stars":76,"addedToBoUI5":"2022-07-23T09:47:57.868Z","createdAt":"2021-04-20T22:14:27Z","updatedAt":"2022-08-03T08:08:47Z","vscodeInstalls":-1,"sourceType":"application","githublink":"https://github.com/SAP-samples/cap-sflight/tree/main/","readme":"# Welcome to the CAP SFLIGHT App\n\nThis is a sample app for the travel reference scenario, built with the [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)](https://cap.cloud.sap) and [SAP Fiori Elements](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/smart-templates).\n\nThe purpose of this sample app is to:\n* Demonstrate SAP Fiori annotations\n* Demonstrate and compare SAP Fiori features on various stacks (CAP Node.js, CAP Java SDK, ABAP)\n* Run UI test suites on various stacks\n\n![Process Travels Page](img.png)\n\nThe app still contains some workarounds that are going to be addressed over time.\nIn some cases, the model and the handlers can be improved or simplified once further planned CAP features become available.\nIn other cases, the app itself could be improved.

The app then becomes visible in the content manager of the SAP Launchpad service.\n\nThe configuration file `mta.yaml` is for the Node.js backend of the app. If you want to deploy the Java backend, copy `mta-java.yaml` to `mta.yaml`.\n\n### Prerequisites\n#### SAP Business Technology Platform\n\n- Create a [trial account on SAP BTP](https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform/trial.html). See this [tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html) for more information. Alternatively, you can use a sub-account in a productive environment.\n- Subscribe to the [SAP Launchpad Service](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-portal-cloud-foundry-getting-started.html).\n- Create an [SAP HANA Cloud Service instance](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-app-hana-cloud-setup.html#08480ec0-ac70-4d47-a759-dc5cb0eb1d58) or use an existing one.\n\n#### Local Machine\n\n- Install the Cloud Foundry command line interface (CLI). See this [tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-cf-download-cli.html) for more details.\n- Install the [MultiApps CF CLI Plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/multiapps-cli-plugin):\n\n  ```shell\n  cf add-plugin-repo CF-Community https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org\n  cf install-plugin multiapps\n  ```\n\n- Install the [Cloud MTA Build Tool](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-mta-build-tool) globally:\n\n  ```shell\n  npm install -g mbt\n   ```\n\n### Build the Project\n\nBuild the project from the command line:\n\n```shell\nmbt build\n```\n\nThe build results will be stored in the directory `mta_archives`.\n\n### Deploy\n\n1. Log in to the target space.\n2. Deploy the MTA archive using the CF CLI: `cf deploy mta_archives/capire.sflight_1.0.0.mtar`\n\n### Assign Role Collection\n\nAny authorized user has read access to the app. For further authorization, assign a role collection to your user in the SAP BTP Cockpit:\n* `sflight-reviewer-{spacename}` for executing actions *Accept Travel*, *Reject Travel*, and *Deduct Discount*\n* `sflight-processor-{spacename}` for full write access\n\n### Local Development with a HANA Cloud Instance\n\nYou need to have access to a HANA Cloud instance and SAP BTP.\n\n1. Deploy the HDI content to a HANA HDI container (which is newly created on first call): `cds deploy --to hana`.\n2. Start the application with the Spring Profile `cloud`.\n   1. From Maven: `mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=cloud`\n   2. From your IDE with the JVM argument `-Dspring.profiles.active=cloud` or env variable `spring.profiles.active=cloud`\n\nThe running application is now connected to its own HDI container/schema. Please keep in mind that the credentials for\nthat HDI container are stored locally on your filesystem (default-env.json).\n\n## Deployment to SAP Business Technology Platform - Kyma Runtime\n\nThe deployment to Kyma Runtime is explained in file [README-Kyma-Runtime.md](./README-Kyma-Runtime.md).\n\n## Creating an SAP Fiori App from Scratch\n\nIf you want to implement an SAP Fiori app, follow these tutorials:\n\n* [Create a List Report Object Page App with SAP Fiori Tools](https://developers.sap.com/group.fiori-tools-lrop.html)\n* [Developing SAP Fiori applications with SAP Fiori Tools](https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US)\n\n## Get Support\n\nIn case you've a question, find a bug, or otherwise need support, use the [SAP Community](https://answers.sap.com/tags/9f13aee1-834c-4105-8e43-ee442775e5ce) to get more visibility.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.

You just add `$metadata` to the base path of the service and save the XML as an own file.\n\nLet's take the Northwind service as example:\n\n- base path: https://services.odata.org/V4/Northwind/Northwind.svc/\n- meta description: https://services.odata.org/V4/Northwind/Northwind.svc/$metadata\n\nEquipped with this meta description file (assume it has been stored as \"metadata.xml\" in the root folder), we call odata2model as npm script in package.json, via npx or yarn:\n\n```\nyarn odata2model -s metadata.xml -o src/types\n```\n\nThis will generate 2 files in the output folder `src/types`:\n\n- NorthwindModel.ts - contains the TypeScript interfaces which describe the response models from the service\n- QNorthwindModel.ts - contains query objects which are highly useful in conjunction with our [ODataUriBuilder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@odata2ts/odata-uri-builder).\n\nThe file names are determined by the service name which is to be found within the meta description of the service.\n\n## Options\n\n| Option         | Shorthand | Required | Default | Description                                                  |\n|

openui5-paginator\n\nopenui5-paginator is a UI5 Custom Control that allow you to handle large data in a Table. Navigation is done via paging.\n\n![Pagiantor preview](preview.PNG)\n\n## Motivation\nWe use openUI5 on the client side as the base technology for our product \"sysHUB\". On the server side, we are using our REST-based API.\nThe main thing is that we are working with large table entries. The base technology of openUI5 and sapUI5 is oData V4 to get data from the backend.\nIn our case, this is not a good choice because we are providing some REST-Services for our customers, and we can not implement REST-Services \nand oData Services to the same time in our product. In an earlier version of openUI5, a paginator was included, but it was removed since 1.45 (I think). \nWe are going on to develop the paginator to work with all newer versions and extend it with some valuable features.\n\n\n## Demo\n\nIf you check out this project, there is a \"demo\" app to see how the paginator works. We are using WebStorm as a development IDE.\nConfigure it as a \"JavaScript Debug\" run configuration to debug the demo app.\n\nYou can also use this link to see a working example:  [openui5-paginator-demo](https://wolfe100.github.io/)\n\n## Usage the control\n\n### Download\n\nCheck out the GIT-Project or download it as ZIP. Furthermore the package is deployed also in NPM\n\n    npm install openui5-paginator\n\n### Configure manifest.json\n\nAdd the library to sap.ui5 dependencies list and configure the resourceRoots to point where you uploaded the custom library.\nIn this case it is the \"thirdparty\" folder in your project. This folder must be in the webapp root location.\n\n```json\n\"sap.ui5\": {\n    ...\n\t\"dependencies\": {\n\t\t\"minUI5Version\": \"1.102.2\",\n\t\t\"libs\": {\n    \t\t...\n\t\t\t\"syshub.controls\": {}\n\t\t}\n\t},\n\t\"resourceRoots\": {\n\t\t\"syshub.controls\": \"./thirdparty/syshub/controls/\"\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Add the custom control inside an XML View\n\nFirst of all add the namespace to the View\n\n```xml\nxmlns:lab=\"syshub.controls\"\nxmlns:t=\"sap.ui.table\"\n\n```\n\nAnd then you can simply add the Paginator custom control to your \"sap.ui.table\". As followed you can see some data bindings.\n\n```xml\n<t:Table ...>\n    <t:footer>\n        <lab:Paginator id=\"idPaginator\"\n                       currentPage=\"{modelEntriesMetadata>/currentPage}\"\n                       entriesAbsolute=\"{modelEntriesMetadata>/entriesAbsolute}\"\n                       entriesPerPage=\"{modelEntriesMetadata>/entriesPerPage}\"\n                       numberOfVisiblePages=\"10\"\n                       showGoto=\"true\"\n                       entriesPerPageVisible = \"true\"\n                       showSpinner=\"{modelEntriesMetadata>/showSpinner}\"\n                       page=\"onPage\"\n                       entriesPerPageChanged = \"onEntriesPerPageChanged\">\n        </lab:Paginator>\n    <t:footer>\n    <t:columns>\n        ...\n    </t:columns>\n</t:Table>\n```\n\n## Parameters\n\n| Name                 | Type   \t| Default | Description\n|:---------------------|:----------\t|:--------| :-----------|\n| currentPage          | number \t| 0       | The current selected page or the page to set\n| entriesAbsolute      | number \t| 0       | The absolute count of the entires given by the query\n| showGoto             | boolean   \t| false   | Shows the direct GOTO input field\n| entriesPerPage       | int    \t| 10      | How much entries should shown of each page\n| numberOfVisiblePages | number\t\t| 10      | How much pages shown which are directly selectable\n| showSpinner          | boolean   \t| false   | Shows a spinner to give the user information to get data from the server\n\n## Events\n\n### entriesPerPageChanged\n| Parameter | Type | Description\n|:----------|:-----| :---------  |\n| offset    | int  | The offset where to start the new query\n| limit     | int  | The new limit is how many entries must be get\n\n### page\n| Parameter  | Type | Description\n|:-----------|:-----| :---------  |\n| srcPage    | int  | The page which is the current one before the page event is fired (and another page is displayed)\n| targetPage | int  | The page that shall be displayed next after the page event is fired\n| offset     | int  | The offset where to start the new query\n| limit      | int  | The limit how many entries must get\n| type      | syshub.controls.PaginatorEvent  | Provides the values 'First', 'Last', 'Next', 'Previous', 'Goto'. The event parameter informs the application how the user navigated to the new page: Whether the 'Next' button was used, or another button, or whether the page was directly selected\n\n\n## Methods\n\n| Name                                     |  Description\n|:-----------------------------------------| :------------------- |\n| setCurrentPage(PageNumber)               | Sets the current page\n| getCurrentPage                           | Gets the current selected page\n| setEntriesAbsolute(AbsoluteQueryEntries) | Sets the absolute query entries to compute the pages\n| getEntriesAbsolute(AbsoluteQueryEntries) | Gets the absolute entries of the current query\n| setShowGoto(boolean value)               | If true, the show \"GOTO\" input field is shown\n| getShowGoto()                            | Return the status of the showGoto property\n| setEntriesPerPage(Number)                | Set the count of the page entries are shown\n| GetEntriesPerPage()                      | Returns the number of page entries shown\n| SetNumberOfVisiblePages(Number)          | Set the count of visible pages are shown\n| getNumberOfVisiblePages()                | Gets the number of visible pages shown\n| setShowSpinner(boolean value)            | If true a spinner is shown, to give the user a feedback\n| getShowSpinner()                         | Gets the status of the spinner\n\n## Build\n\nIf you would like to extend and customize the control, you can easily do that but re-building the code with just a simple ui5 cli commands:\n\n```\nnpm install\nui5 build\nui5 startApp\n```\n\n## How to work with the control\n\nIt is important to have a REST-Service with the following parameters. \n\n    eg: /webapi/v3/data/list?offset=0&limit=20&orderBy=id.desc&search=id<1000\n\nWe use RSQL-Queries in the orderBy and search criteria.\n\nThe first query has no \"id\" inside the search criteria. This means we got a snapshot view of the table\nand got in the response header the \"abs_count\" and the \"highest_id\". All queries while paging\nlimited the query in the search criteria with the highest_id. The reason for this is, that growing up the table\nwith new entries will destroy paging if we don't have the highest_id in the search criteria.\n\n### Known issues\nOne problem which we don't found a solution is removing of entries while paging. This means, \nif another instance removes entries which are included in the query, the result is different, regarding\nthe abs_count and the computing of paging can run in some problems but we live with this limitation.\nOne idear can be, if while paing the abs_count changed the current page can be set to the first one. \n\nPlease have a look of the DataService.js and the mockserver.js to understand how paging is working.\n\n## Important\nIf the value \"entriesAbsolute\" = 0, the paginator is not shown. Be sure, to set this value after a query.\n\n## Credits\n\nWolfgang Haag\n\n - Email: [whaag@nt-ware.com](whaag@nt-ware.com)\n\n## License\nThis project is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details\n","downloadsCurrentMonth":56,"downloadsCurrentFortnight":12,"downloads365":56,"downloadsFortnightGrowth":-72.73,"downloadsHistory":[{"yearMonth":"2021-09","downloads":0},{"yearMonth":"2021-10","downloads":0},{"yearMonth":"2021-11","downloads":0},{"yearMonth":"2021-12","downloads":0},{"yearMonth":"2022-01","downloads":0},{"yearMonth":"2022-02","downloads":0},{"yearMonth":"2022-03","downloads":0},{"yearMonth":"2022-04","downloads":0},{"yearMonth":"2022-05","downloads":0},{"yearMonth":"2022-06","downloads":0},{"yearMonth":"2022-07","downloads":47}],"npmlink":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/openui5-paginator","versions":[{"version":"created","date":"2022-07-27T15:31:26.879Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/openui5-paginator/v/created","changelog":"","sourceType":"library"},{"version":"1.0.0","date":"2022-07-27T15:31:27.113Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/openui5-paginator/v/1.0.0","changelog":"","sourceType":"library"},{"version":"modified","date":"2022-07-27T15:31:27.297Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/openui5-paginator/v/modified","changelog":"","sourceType":"library"}]},{"name":"generator-easy-ui5","version":"3.5.0","description":"Generator for UI5-based project","main":"generators/app/index.js","files":["generators"],"engines":{"node":">=14.0.0"},"scripts":{"test":"mocha","postinstall":"node generators/app/postinstall","lint":"eslint . --fix","prettier":"prettier --write .","start":"yo easy-ui5 project","listSubGen":"yo easy-ui5 project --list","startSubGen":"yo easy-ui5 project app","workaround":"find . -name '.DS_Store' -delete","changelog":"conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s -r 0","postversion":"npm run changelog && git commit --all --amend --no-edit","prepare":"husky install","hooks:commit-msg":"commitlint -e"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/SAP/generator-easy-ui5.git"},"keywords":["yeoman-generator","sap","sapui5","openui5","sapbtp","generator","scaffold"],"author":"SAP","license":"Apache-2.0","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/SAP/generator-easy-ui5/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/SAP/generator-easy-ui5#readme","dependencies":{"@octokit/plugin-throttling":"^4.1.0","@octokit/rest":"^19.0.3","adm-zip":"^0.5.9","chalk":"^4.1.2","colors":"1.4.0","glob":"^7.2.0","libnpmconfig":"^1.2.1","mocha":"^10.0.0","rimraf":"^3.0.2","yarn-or-npm":"^3.0.1","yeoman-assert":"^3.1.1","yeoman-environment":"^3.9.1","yeoman-generator":"^5.6.1","yeoman-test":"^6.3.0","yosay":"^2.0.2"},"devDependencies":{"@commitlint/cli":"17.0.3","@commitlint/config-conventional":"17.0.3","conventional-changelog-cli":"^2.2.2","cz-conventional-changelog":"3.3.0","husky":"^8.0.1","prettier":"2.7.1"},"config":{"commitizen":{"path":"cz-conventional-changelog"}},"commitlint":{"extends":["@commitlint/config-conventional"]},"overrides":{"minimist":"^1.2.6"},"type":"command","tags":["SAP"],"gitHubOwner":"SAP","gitHubRepo":"generator-easy-ui5","licenseSource":"apache-2.0","forks":61,"stars":181,"addedToBoUI5":"2022-07-28T10:22:57.868Z","createdAt":"2019-02-04T10:16:16.598Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-26T10:55:41.613Z","vscodeInstalls":-1,"sourceType":"command","githublink":"https://github.com/SAP/generator-easy-ui5/tree/main/","readme":"# Easy UI5 Generator\n\n[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]\n[![Build Status][test-image]][test-url]\n[![Dependency Status][librariesio-image]][repo-url]\n[![License Status][license-image]][license-url]\n[![REUSE status][reuse-image]][reuse-url]\n\n## Description\n\nEasy-ui5 💙 is a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator which enables you to create simple [SAPUI5](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/)/[OpenUI5](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/)-based web-apps and other UI5-related projects within seconds.\n\nThis generator has been created to simplify the creation of your UI5 prototypes. Now you can scaffold simple UI5 projects from the shell/terminal of your choice. The current best practices (such as [async](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/12/18/ui5ers-buzz-41-best-practices-for-async-loading-in-ui5/)) are already baked into our templates so you don't have to worry about the definition of the metadata files.\n\nThe purpose of this generator is to guide you on your first steps with [SAPUI5](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/) and [SAP BTP](https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html) deployments. Once you are familiar with those technologies, you might want to tweak the projects to adapt them for productive use-cases (such as continuous deployment pipelines and full i18n).\n\n> Starting with easy-ui5 v3, all templates will be outsource to repositories in the [UI5 Community](https://github.com/ui5-community/). This project is from now on a shell that will offer all generators hosted on that GitHub org. Easy-ui5 will download and install these repositories when needed.\n>\n> By default, it will download the repository [generator-ui5-project](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-project/) which contains the templates that were previously integrated in easy-ui5 < 3.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Get [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)  (**version 14 or higher** ⚠️)\n\n## Download and Installation\n\n1. Install the generator\n   ```sh\n   npm install -g yo generator-easy-ui5\n   ```\n2. Verify your installation to see if Yeoman has been installed correctly\n   ```sh\n   yo\n   ```\n   Make sure you see the `easy-ui5` generator listed.\n\n## Bootstrapping a new UI5 project\n\n> Create your first UI5 App within a few seconds!\n\n1. Scaffold your UI5 project\n   ```\n   yo easy-ui5 project\n   ```\n2. Answer the prompts to create your new project\n3. Run it locally\n   ```\n   cd <your project directory>\n   npm start # or \"yarn start\"\n   ```\n\n## Target platforms\n\nDuring the prompting phase, the generator will ask on which target platform your app should run. Currently, the following options are available:\n\n- Static webserver\n- SAP BTP\n- SAP HANA XS Advanced\n- SAP NetWeaver\n\n> Have a look at [this plugin project](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-project/) for more usage instruction and information about the available subcommands.\n\n\n## More generators\n\nAnd this is just the start!\nWe made easy-ui5 extensible, so that the entire [UI5 Community](https://github.com/ui5-community/) can build additional plugins to scaffold any UI5-related development activity.\n\nBy default, this generator comes with the [project-creation-plugin](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-project) but there are many others as well:\n- Create new UI5 libraries [[ui5-community/generator-ui5-library]](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-library)\n- More are coming!\n<!-- - Create new UI5 custom controls\n- Create middlewares for the UI5 tooling\n- Create tasks for the UI5 tooling\n- Create a WDI5 test suite -->\n\nTo download and use any of the plugins above, run the following command\n```sh\nyo easy-ui5 [project|library] # this is the name of the repositorty without the \"generator-ui5-\" prefix\n```\n\n<!-- Are you missing a generator in this list and are you willing to provide one to the entire UI5 community? Great! [This blog posts](TODO INSERT LINK HERE) contains everything you need to know to get started!  -->\n\n## Calling generators\n\nRun the following command to see all subgenerators of a given plugin\n```sh\nyo easy-ui5 [project|library] --list\n```\nOnce you decided on the subgenerator, run:\n\nRun the following command to see all subgenerators of a given plugin\n```sh\nyo easy-ui5 [project|library] <sub-generator-id>\n```\n\n## How to obtain support\n\nPlease use the GitHub bug tracking system to post questions, bug reports or to create pull requests.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome any type of contribution (code contributions, pull requests, issues) to this easy-ui5 generator equally.\n\nPlease follow our instructions if you would like to

UI5 proxy middleware using routes\n\nMiddleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), enabling proxy support.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-middleware-route-proxy --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- debug: `boolean`\n  enable logging\n- root directory of the request uri: `object`\n  used to match and forward requests to your server. Needs to include the leading slash  character (`/`).\n  - target: `string`\n    hostname of your backend server\n  - replacePath: `string` optional. If the request path needs to be modified by taking out the root directory uri\n  - auth: `object`\n    authorization object with username and password ( pass `false` if authorization is not required )\n    - user: `string`\n    - pass: `string` \n    - client: `string` optional. If the client is not the default client on the SAP system\n    - header: `string` optional. Is used as value for the `Authorization` header if available. `user` and `pass` values are not used in this case.\n  - changeOrigin: `boolean` optional. If provided, the value will be added to the [options of the http-proxy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-proxy#options).\n  \nEach `boolean` or `string` field in a root path object can either represent the actual value or the name of a parameter in a .env file. \n\nExample:\n```yml\n      debug: true\n      /sap: \n        target: http(s)://host:port\n        replacePath: true\n        auth:\n          user: Username\n          pass: Password!\n          client: '100' \n```\n\nExample with target/user/pass in .env file:\n```yaml\n      debug: true\n      /sap: \n        target: PROXY_TARGET\n        auth:\n          user: PROXY_USERNAME\n          pass: PROXY_PASSWORD\n          client: PROXY_CLIENT\n```\n\nExample with target and dedicated `Authorization` header in .env file:\n```yaml\n      debug: true\n      /sap: \n        target: PROXY_TARGET\n        auth:\n          header: PROXY_AUTHORIZATION\n        changeOrigin: true\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-route-proxy\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n},\n\"ui5\": {\n  \"dependencies\": [\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-route-proxy\",\n    // ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> As the devDependencies are not recognized by the UI5 tooling, they need to be listed in the `ui5 > dependencies` array. In addition, once using the `ui5 > dependencies` array you need to list all UI5 tooling relevant dependencies.\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-route-proxy\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      debug: true\n      /routeRootPath: \n        target: PROXY_TARGET\n        auth:\n          user: PROXY_USERNAME\n          pass: PROXY_PASSWORD\n```\n\n3.

This will generate the resources with a path that can be found by the cachebuster. \n\nFor example a file with name \"Component-dbg.js\" will be cloned to  \"~1618522173771~/Component-dbg.js\", or another example \"model/models.js\" will be cloned to \"~1618522173782~/model/models.js\".\n\nIt is not needed to run the \"generateCachebusterInfo\" task as this already done inside this one. Nevertheless, this task should always be executed after the cachebuster info generation \"generateCachebusterInfo\".\n\n## Known limitations\n\nThe task \"generateCachebusterInfo\" can be configured to use timestamp or hash. This task only supports timestamp as it's currently not possible to acces the global config inside a custom task.","jsdoc":{},"downloadsCurrentMonth":960,"downloadsCurrentFortnight":514,"downloads365":8057,"downloadsFortnightGrowth":15.25,"downloadsHistory":[{"yearMonth":"2021-09","downloads":71},{"yearMonth":"2021-10","downloads":88},{"yearMonth":"2021-11","downloads":61},{"yearMonth":"2021-12","downloads":119},{"yearMonth":"2022-01","downloads":639},{"yearMonth":"2022-02","downloads":1425},{"yearMonth":"2022-03","downloads":1042},{"yearMonth":"2022-04","downloads":1096},{"yearMonth":"2022-05","downloads":1208},{"yearMonth":"2022-06","downloads":1005},{"yearMonth":"2022-07","downloads":773}],"npmlink":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-cachebuster-indexing","versions":[{"version":"created","date":"2021-04-13T21:51:25.631Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-cachebuster-indexing/v/created","changelog":"","sourceType":"task"},{"version":"1.0.0","date":"2021-04-13T21:51:25.744Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-cachebuster-indexing/v/1.0.0","changelog":"","sourceType":"task"},{"version":"modified","date":"2022-05-22T16:30:00.663Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-cachebuster-indexing/v/modified","changelog":"","sourceType":"task"},{"version":"1.0.2","date":"2021-04-19T20:46:09.932Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-cachebuster-indexing/v/1.0.2","changelog":"","sourceType":"task"}]},{"name":"ui5-task-transpile-gen","version":"1.0.4","description":"UI5tooling transpile code from ES6 to ES5 including Async Await syntax","main":"index.js","scripts":{"test":"echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"},"author":"Wouter Lemaire","license":"MIT","repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/lemaiwo/ui5-task-transpile-gen.git"},"dependencies":{"@babel/core":"^7.9.0","@babel/plugin-transform-modules-commonjs":"^7.9.0","@babel/preset-env":"^7.9.0","@ui5/fs":"^1.1.2","colors":"^1.4.0","node-emoji":"^1.10.0","regenerator-runtime":"^0.13.3"},"type":"task","tags":["transpiler","regenerator-runtime"],"gitHubOwner":"lemaiwo","gitHubRepo":"ui5-task-transpile-gen","licenseSource":"mit","forks":1,"stars":1,"addedToBoUI5":"2022-07-31T19:37:57.868Z","createdAt":"2020-02-20T11:30:07.000Z","updatedAt":"2022-05-22T16:30:35.696Z","vscodeInstalls":-1,"sourceType":"task","githublink":"https://github.com/lemaiwo/ui5-task-transpile-gen/tree/master/","readme":"# ui5-task-transpile-gen\nUI5tooling task for transpiling ES6 to ES5 including Async Await\n\nTask for [ui5-builder](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-builder), enabling ES6 support.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-task-transpile-gen --save-dev\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n1.
