Feel free to use it, open issues, contribute, and help answering questions.\n\nThe `ui5-middleware-cap` is a UI5 CLI middleware which is used to improve the development experience for the node runtime of the [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/about/) and enables the integration of a CDS server into the UI5 development server via the CDS server express middlewares. In addition to the middleware the CDS server project needs to be added as dependency so that the server is detected and attached properly. The pre-defined routes in the CDS server are reused.\n\n> :construction: **Note**\n> This middleware is still work in progress and not final yet!\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Requires at least [`@ui5/cli@3.0.0`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/v3/pages/CLI/) (to support [`specVersion: \"3.0\"`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/pages/Configuration/#specification-version-30))\n\n> :warning: **UI5 CLI Compatibility**\n> All releases of this UI5 CLI extension using the major version `3` require UI5 CLI V3. Any previous releases below major version `3` (if available) also support older versions of the UI5 CLI. But the usage of the latest UI5 CLI is strongly recommended!\n\n## Usage\n\nAdd a `devDependency` to the `ui5-middleware-cap`:\n\n```sh\nnpm add ui5-middleware-cap -D\n```\n\nRegister the middleware in the `ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-cap\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    mountPath: \"/cap\"\n```\n\nThat's it!\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- `moduleId`: `<string>`\nIf specified, the CDS server will be loaded from the NPM package with the given moduleId (package name). If not provided, the middleware will lookup the CDS server from the project `dependencies` or `devDependencies`.\n- `mountPath`: `<string>`\nIf specified, the CDS server will be available at the specified url.\n- `options`: `<object>` (default: `{ \"with-mocks\": true, \"in-memory?\": true }` )\nAllows to provide some CLI options for the `cds serve` command which is called internally to create the middleware functions and embed them into the UI5 development server:\n  - `with-mocks`: `<boolean>`\n    It starts in-process mock services for all required services configured in package.json#cds.requires, which don't have external bindings in the current process environment.\n  - `in-memory[?]`: `<boolean>`\n    Automatically adds a transient in-memory database bootstrapped on each (re-)start in the same way cds deploy would do, based on defaults or configuration in package.json#cds.requires.db. Add a question mark to apply a more defensive variant which respects the configured database, if any, and only adds an in-memory database if no persistent one is configured.\n\n## Support\n\nPlease use the GitHub bug tracking system to post questions, bug reports or to create pull requests.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAny type of contribution (code contributions, pull requests, issues) to this set of UI5 CLI extensions will be equally appreciated.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

UI5 middleware using `@sap/approuter` for service connectivity\n\n> :wave: This is a **community project** and there is no official support for this package! Feel free to use it, open issues, contribute, and help answering questions.\n\nMiddleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), making `destinations` configured in SAP Cloud Foundry or SAP XS Advanced available for local development using the [`http-proxy-middleware`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-proxy-middleware).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Requires at least [`@ui5/cli@3.0.0`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/v3/pages/CLI/) (to support [`specVersion: \"3.0\"`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/pages/Configuration/#specification-version-30))\n\n> :warning: **UI5 CLI Compatibility**\n> All releases of this UI5 CLI extension using the major version `3` require UI5 CLI V3. Any previous releases below major version `3` (if available) also support older versions of the UI5 CLI. But the usage of the latest UI5 CLI is strongly recommended!\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-middleware-approuter --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- `debug`: `<boolean>`, default: `false`  \nverbose logging\n- `port`: `<int>`, default: `5000`  \nport to run the underlying `approuter` on\n\n- `xsappJson`: `<string>`, default: `\"./xs-app.json\"`  \npath to the cf-style approuter configuration file `xs-app.json`\n:information_source: the regex for the destination routes must match the pattern : `/[^/]*\\/(.*\\/)?[^/]*/`, e.g. `\"^/backend/(.*)$\"` or `\"^/index.html\"`\n\n- `destinations`: `<string[]>`, default: `[]`\n  - `name: <string>` destination name, matching the one used in routes in `xs-app.json`  \n  - `url: <string>` URI to the host to \"proxy\" to  \n  \n  alternatively the destinations can also be defined in a `.env` file. They need to be in encoded in a single JSON string  \n  e.g.\n\n  ```properties\n  xsapp_dest = [{\"name\": \"destination-name\", \"url\": \"<some-service-url>\"}]\n  ```\n\n  To use these destinations they need to passed to the `destinations` option as a string `\"$env:<key-in-env-file>\"` (e.g. `destinations: \"$env:xsapp_dest\"`)\n\n- `allowServices`: `<boolean>`, default: `false`  \nallow [BTP services](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog?) to be used at runtime that are configured in `xs-app.json`  \n(requires an authenticated BTP session!)\n\n- `authenticationMethod`: `\"none\"` || `\"route\"`, default: `\"none\"`  \nwhether to equip routes with authentication\n\n- `allowLocalDir`: `<boolean>`, default: `false`  \nallow static assets to be picked up by the included `approuter`; defaults to `false` as usually all local files/assets are supposedly served by `ui5-server`\n\n- `rewriteContent`: `<boolean>`, default: `true`  \nenables/disables rewriting of the content by replacing the proxied url in the response body with the server url\n\n- `rewriteContentTypes`: `<string[]>`, default: `[\"text/html\", \"application/json\", \"application/atom+xml\", \"application/xml\"]`  \ndefines the content types which are included for rewriting the content by enabling the `rewriteContent` option\n\n- `extensions`: `<string[]>`, default: `[]` - a list of extensions to be required and injected into the local approuter instance\n  - `module: <string>` - local module path (must start with `./`): `\"./my-local-extension.js\"` or a module from an npm package: `\"@my-scope/my-package/my-extension.js\"`\n  - `parameters: <Map<string, string>>`, optional - a map of parameters given as key value pairs which will be injected into the handler function of the extension as the last (4th) argument (`function(req, res, next, params)`, remark: handler functions with more than 3 arguments will not be called for regular extensions only for these extensions!)\n\n- `disableWelcomeFile`: `<boolean>`, default: `false` *experimental*\ndisables the welcome file handling of the approuter based on the `welcomeFile` property in the `xsappJson` file\n\n- `appendAuthRoute`: `<boolean>`, default: `false` *experimental*\nif `true` the middleware adds a custom route for all HTML pages to trigger authentication:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"source\": \"^/([^.]+\\\\.html?(?:\\\\?.*)?)$\",\n    \"localDir\": relativeSourcePath,\n    \"target\": \"$1\",\n    \"cacheControl\": \"no-store\",\n    \"authenticationType\": \"xsuaa\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n- `enableWebSocket`: `<boolean>`, default: `false` *experimental*\nenables support for proxying web sockets, will be also automatically detected from `xs-app.json`\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-approuter\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-middleware-approuter\n      afterMiddleware: compression\n      configuration:\n        authenticationMethod: \"none\" # \"none\" || \"route\", default: \"none\"\n        allowServices: true # allows BTP services like SAP IoT to be used \n        debug: true\n        port: 1091\n        xsappJson: \"xs-app.json\"\n        destinations:\n          # check that the destination name (here: \"backend\") matches your router in xs-app.json\n          - name: \"backend\"\n            url: \"https://services.odata.org/V4/(S(fdng4tbvlxgzpdtpfap2rqss))/TripPinServiceRW/\"\n```\n\n3. put the cf routing config file `xs-app.json` in the location of `$yourapp` you specified above (`xsappJson`) -  \nrecommendation is to put it at the root `/` of your UI5 app!\n\n## How it works\n\nThe middleware wraps the `@sap/approuter` npm module that is used in the SAP BTP CloudFoundry environment for serving UI5 applications, including proxying the configured destinations.\n\nDuring development, the `approuter` is started on a configurable port, running alongside the regular local `ui5-server`. When a call to a URL destination is detected at `$webserver/destination`, it is proxied to `$approuter:$port` via [`request`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request).\n\n### Using `approuter` extensions\n\nThe `ui5-middleware-approuter` allows using `approuter` extensions. It is possible to pass parameters to handler functions of the extensions as a 4th argument of the handler function.\n\nThe configuration of the extensions in the `ui5.yaml` looks like that:\n\n```yaml\n    - name: ui5-middleware-approuter\n      afterMiddleware: compression\n      configuration:\n        extensions:\n          - module: ./approuter-local-ext.js\n            parameters:\n              userId: mustermann@ui5.com\n```\n\nAnd in the `approuter-local-ext.js` you can consume the parameters like that:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n    insertMiddleware: {\n        beforeRequestHandler: [\n            {\n                path: '/',\n                handler: function forwardUserInfo(req, res, next, params) {\n                    res.setHeader('x-user-id', params?.userId || \"unknown@ui5.com\")\n                    next()\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nKeep in mind that the 4th parameter doesn't work for the regular `approuter` extensions and the handler function will not be called when having more than 3 arguments.\n\n## Misc/FAQ\n\n**q**: does authentication on destinations  \n**a**: yes, works 🥳\n\n- prerequisite: a `default-env.json` file at the root `/` of your UI5 app\nBespoken `default-env.json` file can be obtained [via the `Default Env CLI Plugin`](https://github.com/saphanaacademy/DefaultEnv)\n- `ui5.yaml > server > customMiddlware > ui5-middleware-approuter`: set `authenticationMethod` to `route` (see config example above)\n- `xs-app.json` (also at the root `/` of your UI5 app):\n  - set `authenticationMethod` to `route`\n  - in the route with the desired protected authentication, set `authenticationType` to `xsuaa`  \n\nsee `./test/auth/**/*` for example files for the above!\n\n**q**: what's `allowLocalDir` for?  \n**a**: allows to protect local static assets (e.g. `html` files) -in addition to destinations- with approuter as well.  \nsee `test/auth/xs-app-with-localDir.json` for an example!\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

UI5 middleware for syncing interactions across browsers\n\n> :wave: This is a **community project** and there is no official support for this package! Feel free to use it, open issues, contribute, and help answering questions.\n\nMiddleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), syncing interactions between different browsers, hopefully somewhat easing manual testing :)  \n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Requires at least [`@ui5/cli@3.0.0`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/v3/pages/CLI/) (to support [`specVersion: \"3.0\"`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/pages/Configuration/#specification-version-30))\n\n> :warning: **UI5 CLI Compatibility**\n> All releases of this UI5 CLI extension using the major version `3` require UI5 CLI V3. Any previous releases below major version `3` (if available) also support older versions of the UI5 CLI. But the usage of the latest UI5 CLI is strongly recommended!\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-middleware-iasync --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- `https: <boolean>` default: false  \nwhether to use the middleware via SSL/wss\n- `httpModule: <string>`, default: undefined  \ncapability to e.g. use `http2`\n- `port: <integer>`, default: 3000  \nport to run middleware at\n- `debug: <boolean>`, default: false  \ndisplay extensive logging\n- `logConnections: <boolean>`, default: true  \nshow connected browsers\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-iasync\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-iasync\n    beforeMiddleware: serveResources\n    configuration:\n      https: false\n      debug: false\n      logConnections: true\n      port: 4711\n```\n\n## How it works\n\n`iasync` uses [browsersync.io](https://www.browsersync.io) under the hood. It transmits user interactions of the UI via a websocket pool. Respectively, all browsers connected to `http://ui5-app:port` open a websocket connection, listening for and receiving interactions events.  \n\nAdditionally, `iasync` injects custom HTML into `index.html`, manipulating browser event handlers of UI5 controls - see `lib/ui5mangler.html`. E.g. the `sap.m.Button`'s click event is overwritten with its' tap event.\n\n## Misc/FAQ\n\n> Watch Out!  \n> Due to manipulation of the UI5 controls (see above), interactions of the UI might lead to unexpected results!\n\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

UI5 middleware for delivering a welcome/start/'index' page to the client\n\n> :wave: This is a **community project** and there is no official support for this package! Feel free to use it, open issues, contribute, and help answering questions.\n\nMiddleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), delivering the `$index.html` of choice (instead of the directory listing).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Requires at least [`@ui5/cli@3.0.0`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/v3/pages/CLI/) (to support [`specVersion: \"3.0\"`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/pages/Configuration/#specification-version-30))\n\n> :warning: **UI5 CLI Compatibility**\n> All releases of this UI5 CLI extension using the major version `3` require UI5 CLI V3. Any previous releases below major version `3` (if available) also support older versions of the UI5 CLI. But the usage of the latest UI5 CLI is strongly recommended!\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-middleware-index --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- debug: `<boolean>`, default: `false`\n- welcomeFile: `<string>`, default: `index.html`\n  the file to redirect to when the root path `/` is requested\n- index: `<string>`, default: `index.html`  *deprecated*\n  file inside `$yourapp` to deliver for `http://<host>:<port>/`\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-index\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-index\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      welcomeFile: \"index_peter.html\"\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nThe middleware delivers the configured `index` HTML-file to the client if the FQDN + trailing slash `/` is requested in the browser.\n\n## Development\n\nIf you want to contribute to `ui5-middleware-index`, please use [`Prettier`](https://prettier.io) for code formatting/style and apply the rules from `./.prettierrc`.

UI5 middleware for live reloading `webapp` sources on change\n\n> :wave: This is a **community project** and there is no official support for this package! Feel free to use it, open issues, contribute, and help answering questions.\n\nMiddleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), doing a live reload when files inside `$yourapp` change, e.g. on save.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Requires at least [`@ui5/cli@3.0.0`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/v3/pages/CLI/) (to support [`specVersion: \"3.0\"`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/pages/Configuration/#specification-version-30))\n\n> :warning: **UI5 CLI Compatibility**\n> All releases of this UI5 CLI extension using the major version `3` require UI5 CLI V3. Any previous releases below major version `3` (if available) also support older versions of the UI5 CLI. But the usage of the latest UI5 CLI is strongly recommended!\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-middleware-livereload --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- debug: true|false  \n  verbose logging\n- extraExts: `string`, default: `jsx,ts,tsx,xml,json,properties` \n  file extensions other than `js`, `html` and `css` to monitor for changes\n- port: `integer`, default: an free port choosen from `35729` onwards\n  port the live reload server is started on\n- watchPath|path: `string`, default: all paths from app and non framework dependencies\n  path inside `$yourapp` the reload server monitors for changes\n- exclusions: one or many `regex`. By default, this includes `.git/`, `.svn/`, and `.hg/`\n- usePolling: true|false, default: `false`\n  Enables chokidar polling to support virtualised filesystems(eg. WSL2.0).\n- includeFwkDeps: true|false, default: `false`\n  Includes the framework dependencies into the `watchPath`\n- includeAppDeps: true|false, default: `false`\n  Includes the application dependencies into the `watchPath`\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-livereload\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-livereload\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n```\n\nUsing the configuration properties:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-livereload\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      debug: true\n      extraExts: \"xml,json,properties\"\n      port: 35729\n      watchPath: \"webapp\"\n```\n\nor with `path` instead of `watchPath`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-livereload\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      debug: true\n      extraExts: \"xml,json,properties\"\n      port: 35729\n      path: \"webapp\"\n```\n\nReload from multiple paths:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-livereload\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      debug: true\n      extraExts: \"xml,json,properties\"\n      port: 35729\n      path: \n            - \"webapp\"\n            - \"../my.reuse.library/src/my/reuse/library\"\n```\n\nUse polling to watch files:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-livereload\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      debug: true\n      extraExts: \"xml,json,properties\"\n      port: 35729\n      usePolling: true\n```\n\nExclude single subpath from `path`s/ `watchPath`s:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-livereload\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      debug: true\n      extraExts: \"xml,json,properties\"\n      port: 35729\n      watchPath: \"webapp\"\n      exclusions:\n            - \"wdi5/\"\n```\n\nExclude multiple subpaths from  `path`s/ `watchPath`s:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-livereload\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      debug: true\n      extraExts: \"xml,json,properties\"\n      port: 35729\n      watchPath: \"webapp\"\n      exclusions:\n          - \"wdi5/\"\n          - \"integration/\"\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nThe middleware launches a `livereload`-server on the specified `port`, listening to changes in the app and any of the non framework dependencies or alternativly the specified `path` or `watchPath` inside your application directory.\n\nWhen changes are detected, a reload is triggered to **all connected clients** - so all browsers having `$yourapp` will reload the application. The reload is `#`-aware, meaning the current displayed route in your single-page UI5 app is kept steady.\n\n## HTTP/2 support\n\nThe middleware supports HTTP/2 automatically, when the UI5 server is started with the --h2 option. It uses the same SSL key and certificate, either set using the --key and --cert options, or using the default ~/.ui5/server/server.key and ~/.ui5/server/server.crt.\n\n## Misc/FAQ\n\nyep, cross-browser, cross-platform.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

But the usage of the latest UI5 CLI is strongly recommended!\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-middleware-onelogin --save-dev\n\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\nCurrently you can define the properties in the configuration (see below) or the following environment variables are used.\n\n- path: `string` either the url or the hostname and port of the SAP system\n- subdirectory`(optional)`: `string` the subdirectory that is appended to the path, defaults to the fiori launchpad at /sap/bc/ui2/flp\n- username`(optional)`: `string` Username to be used to login to the launchpad\n- password`(optional)`: `string`Password used to login\n- useCertificate`(optional)`: `boolean` use a certificate to login instead of username and password\n- debug`(optional)`: `boolean` true will open up the playwright browser so you can see what's going on\n\n**NB1:** If you choose to use the certificate login then check the property AutoSelectCertificateForUrls in chrome://policy if it holds the url pattern for your system. [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/1799) has an issue to handle the certificate prompt. Another workaround is to set debug and useCertificate to true in the configuration and press ok when the prompt opens\n\n**NB2:** If your system does not host a fiori launchpad, you will have to adjust the subdirectory to point to a different login protected page. In the case of a MII java stack that hosts an OData service, try setting subdirectory to XMII/PropertyAccessServlet?Mode=List\n\nYou can either add the following properties to your .env file, remember to add that to your .gitignore\n\n- UI5_MIDDLEWARE_ONELOGIN_LOGIN_URL or UI5_MIDDLEWARE_SIMPLE_PROXY_BASEURI\n- UI5_MIDDLEWARE_ONELOGIN_LOGIN_SUBDIRECTORY\n- UI5_MIDDLEWARE_ONELOGIN_USERNAME\n- UI5_MIDDLEWARE_ONELOGIN_PASSWORD\n- UI5_MIDDLEWARE_ONELOGIN_USE_CERTIFICATE\n- UI5_MIDDLEWARE_ONELOGIN_QUERY or UI5_MIDDLEWARE_SIMPLE_PROXY_QUERY\n- UI5_MIDDLEWARE_ONELOGIN_DEBUG\n\nUse of environment variables or values set in a `.env` file will be used.\n\nOther options is to either set it in the yaml file or if left blank it will prompt you for the details.\n\nYou can choose to just add the url and let the rest be prompted in the terminal\n![Login prompt](./assets/prompt.png)\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-onelogin\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-middleware-onelogin\n      afterMiddleware: compression\n      configuration:\n        path: <Login URL>\n        username: <Login User>\n        password: <Login Password>\n        useCertificate: true / false (use a certificate to login instead of username and password)\n        debug: true / false (true will open up the playwright browser so you can see what's going on)\n        query:\n          sap-client: \"206\"\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

UI5 middleware to serve a locally built UI5 framework version\n\n> :wave: This is a **community project** and there is no official support for this package! Feel free to use it, open issues, contribute, and help answering questions.\n\nMiddleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), delivering the UI5 framework from a locally built version. The first time a UI5 version is being used (derived from the framework configuration of the project), it will be built and locally stored in the `~/.ui5/ui5-middleware-serveframework` folder per version. For any follow-up usage of the version, it will be served from the local folder. Benefits are the usage of the preload files and pure static file access.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Requires at least [`@ui5/cli@3.0.0`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/v3/pages/CLI/) (to support [`specVersion: \"3.0\"`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/pages/Configuration/#specification-version-30))\n\n> :warning: **UI5 CLI Compatibility**\n> All releases of this UI5 CLI extension using the major version `3` require UI5 CLI V3. Any previous releases below major version `3` (if available) also support older versions of the UI5 CLI. But the usage of the latest UI5 CLI is strongly recommended!\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-middleware-serveframework --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- `debug`: *`boolean`*, default: `false`\n- `ui5VersionEnvVariable`: *`string`*\n  Name of environment variable that contains ui5 version (in case you want to override framework version from ui5.yaml)\n- `envFilePath`: *`string`*, default: `./.env`\n  Path to file with environment variables\n- `strictSSL`: `boolean`\n  Ignore strict SSL checks. Default value `true`.\n- `saveLibsLocal`: `boolean`, default: `false`\n  When enabled, libraries are saved in the project directory (.ui5-middleware-serveframework) instead of the user home directory. While this isolates the libraries per project, it requires additional disk space and compilation time compared to sharing compiled libraries across projects.\n- `cachePath`: `string`\n  Custom path to store cached framework files. By default, files are stored in the user home directory (~/.ui5/ui5-middleware-serveframework) or project directory depending on saveLibsLocal setting.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-serveframework\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-serveframework\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      ui5VersionEnvVariable: UI5_VERSION\n      envFilePath: \"./.dev.env\"\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nThe middleware looks-up the UI5 framework version in the `ui5.yaml` and then first builds the framework with all libraries locally and serves the content of those libraries from there.\n\n## Development\n\nIf you want to contribute to `ui5-middleware-serveframework`, please use [`Prettier`](https://prettier.io) for code formatting/style and apply the rules from `./.prettierrc`.

UI5 serve static middleware\n\n> :wave: This is a **community project** and there is no official support for this package! Feel free to use it, open issues, contribute, and help answering questions.\n\nMiddleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), enabling to serve static resources.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Requires at least [`@ui5/cli@3.0.0`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/v3/pages/CLI/) (to support [`specVersion: \"3.0\"`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/pages/Configuration/#specification-version-30))\n\n> :warning: **UI5 CLI Compatibility**\n> All releases of this UI5 CLI extension using the major version `3` require UI5 CLI V3. Any previous releases below major version `3` (if available) also support older versions of the UI5 CLI. But the usage of the latest UI5 CLI is strongly recommended!\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-middleware-servestatic --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- debug: `boolean`\n  debug logging\n- rootPath: `string`\n  the root path to the static resources on your system (absolute or relative path to app)\n- npmPackagePath: `string`\n  the npm package path pointing to the root path for the static resources (e.g. \"`@scope/packageName/path`\", \"`packageName/path`\", \"`packageName`\")\n\n> Hints:\n> * If a `rootPath` is given, the `npmPackagePath` will be ignored\n> * Values for `rootPath` or `npmPackagePath` can be also provided by environment variables by using the prefix `env.` e.g. `rootPath: env.MY_ENV_VAR`\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-servestatic\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:  \n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-servestatic\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    mountPath: /resources\n    configuration:\n      rootPath: \"/Users/Me/upkg/sapui5-runtime-1.70/resources\"\n```\n\nExample which uses Environment Variables from `.env` file\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-servestatic\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    mountPath: /resources\n    configuration:\n      rootPath: ${env.SAPUI5_SDK_1_60__RESOURCES}\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nThe middleware integrates [serve-static](https://github.com/expressjs/serve-static) to serve static resources from a specified `rootPath`.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

UI5 simple proxy middleware\n\nMiddleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), enabling proxy support.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Requires at least [`@ui5/cli@3.0.0`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/v3/pages/CLI/) (to support [`specVersion: \"3.0\"`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/pages/Configuration/#specification-version-30))\n\n> :warning: **UI5 CLI Compatibility**\n> All releases of this UI5 CLI extension using the major version `3` require UI5 CLI V3. Any previous releases below major version `3` (if available) also support older versions of the UI5 CLI. But the usage of the latest UI5 CLI is strongly recommended!\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-middleware-simpleproxy --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- `baseUri`: `string`\n  The baseUri to proxy. Can also be set using the `UI5_MIDDLEWARE_SIMPLE_PROXY_BASEURI` environment variable. To proxy WebSockets just use a WebSocket URL, e.g. `ws://echo.websocket.org`. *Hint: the `mountPath` of the middleware is not considered for the baseUri. It's just used as is!*\n- `strictSSL`: `boolean`\n  Ignore strict SSL checks. Default value `true`. Can also be set using the `UI5_MIDDLEWARE_SIMPLE_PROXY_STRICT_SSL` environment variable.\n- `removeETag`:  `boolean`\n  Removes the ETag header from the response to avoid conditional requests.\n- `username`:  `string`\n  Username used for Basic Authentication.\n- `password`:  `string`\n  Password used for Basic Authentication.\n- `httpHeaders`: `map`\n  Http headers set for the proxied request. Will overwrite the http headers from the request. \n- `query`: `map`\n  Query parameters set for the proxied request. Will overwrite the parameters from the request. \n- `excludePatterns`: `string[]`\n  Array of exclude patterns using glob syntax\n- `skipCache`: `boolean`\n  Remove the cache guid when serving from the FLP launchpad if it matches an excludePattern\n- `enableWebSocket`: `<boolean>`, default: `false` *experimental*\nenables support for proxying web sockets\n\nIn general, use of environment variables or values set in a `.env` file will override configuration values in the `ui5.yaml`.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-simpleproxy\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-simpleproxy\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    mountPath: /odata\n    configuration:\n      baseUri: \"https://services.odata.org\"\n      username: myUsername\n      password: myPassword\n      httpHeaders:\n        Any-Header: AnyHeader\n      query:\n        sap-client: '206'\n      excludePatterns:\n      - \"/local/**\"\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nThe middleware launches a simple `proxy`-server which proxies the requests to the given uri. Internally, it uses the express proxy middleware.\n\n## How to ignore self-signed certificates?\n\nIn case you are using HTTPS and self-signed certificates, you may see an error as displayed below:\n\n```bash\nError: unable to verify the first certificate\n    at TLSSocket.onConnectSecure (_tls_wrap.js:1321:34)\n    at TLSSocket.emit (events.js:210:5)\n    at TLSSocket._finishInit (_tls_wrap.js:794:8)\n    at TLSWrap.ssl.onhandshakedone (_tls_wrap.js:608:12)\n```\n\nTo avoid it, you can set the `strictSSL` value in proxy request to be `false`. Its default value is `true`.\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-simpleproxy\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    mountPath: /odata\n    configuration:\n      baseUri: \"http://services.odata.org\"\n      strictSSL: false\n```\n\n## .env support\n\nThis plugin supports use of a `.env` file to declare environment variable values for configuration as described above. The file should be put in the same directory where you run `ui5 build`, `ui5 serve`, etc. The file might have contents like:\n\n```shell\nUI5_MIDDLEWARE_SIMPLE_PROXY_BASEURI=https://host.tld:1234/sap\nUI5_MIDDLEWARE_SIMPLE_PROXY_STRICT_SSL=false\nUI5_MIDDLEWARE_SIMPLE_PROXY_USERNAME=myUsername\nUI5_MIDDLEWARE_SIMPLE_PROXY_PASSWORD=myPassword\n```\n\n## Hints\n\nIf you are using the Microsoft OData services for testing purposes, like [Northwind](https://services.odata.org/v2/northwind/northwind.svc/) for V2 or [TripPin](https://www.odata.org/blog/trippin-new-odata-v4-sample-service/) for V4, please ensure to use the `https` URLs instead of the `http` URLs. The `http` URL will redirect to `https` but instead of the proxy it will try to directly connect to the Microsoft OData services.\n\nAnother known issue is the the validation of the `csrf-token` fails for the `$batch` requests (e.g. in Chrome). To workaround this issue, also running the dev server in `https` can solve the issue.\n\nUI5 CLI supports running the dev server in `https` by running the following command line option:\n\n```sh\nui5 serve --h2\n```\n\n**Note:** With Node v24, usage of HTTP/2 is no longer supported in UI5 CLI. Please check https://github.com/UI5/cli/issues/327 for updates.\n\nMore details can be found in the documentation of the UI5 CLI for the [`ui5 serve` command](https://ui5.github.io/cli/stable/pages/CLI/#ui5-serve).\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

UI5 middleware to include UI5 application dependencies\n\n> :wave: This is a **community project** and there is no official support for this package! Feel free to use it, open issues, contribute, and help answering questions.\n\nMiddleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), to include and serve UI5 application dependencies in the same server instance.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Requires at least [`@ui5/cli@3.0.0`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/v3/pages/CLI/) (to support [`specVersion: \"3.0\"`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/pages/Configuration/#specification-version-30))\n\n> :warning: **UI5 CLI Compatibility**\n> All releases of this UI5 CLI extension using the major version `3` require UI5 CLI V3. Any previous releases below major version `3` (if available) also support older versions of the UI5 CLI. But the usage of the latest UI5 CLI is strongly recommended!\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-middleware-ui5 --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\nThe plugin accepts configuration to control the mount path and selected configuration options for the UI5 server middlewares which are embedded into the current UI5 server via an express router.\n\n- debug: `boolean`  \n  enable detailed logging\n\n- serveFromNamespace: `boolean` (defaults to `true`)\n  serves the UI5 application from the `/resources/%namespace%` so that the UI5 application can be resolved without any additional `resourceroots` mapping; when disabled (setting option to `false`) the UI5 application will be served from it's `mountPath` (typically the UI5 app `name` or as fallback the `moduleId`); a custom `mountPath` configuration (see below) disables this configuration option!\n\n- modules: `Object`\n  modules configuration (key = moduleId, values = object) - details in the following sections about the module configuration\n\n### Module Configuration: Mount Path\n\nThe mount path of the UI5 application configures the nested Router for the UI5 server middlewares to run under this predefined path. It is by default derived from the `metadata/name` of the `ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nspecVersion: \"3.0\"\nmetadata:\n  name: ui5.bookshop\ntype: application\n```\n\nThis configuration can be overruled by adding a the `customConfiguration/ui5-middleware-ui5/mountPath` option into the `ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nspecVersion: \"3.0\"\nmetadata:\n  name: ui5.bookshop\ntype: application\ncustomConfiguration:\n  ui5-middleware-ui5:\n    mountPath: /bookshop\n```\n\nIn some cases it is necessary to overrule the UI5 application local configuration. Therefore, you can use the configuration of the middleware in your `ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nspecVersion: \"3.0\"\nmetadata:\n  name: ui5.bookshop\ntype: application\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-middleware-ui5\n      afterMiddleware: compression\n      configuration:\n        modules:\n          %moduleId%:\n            mountPath: \"/app\"\n```\n\nThe `moduleId` is the `name` from the `package.json`.\n\n### Module Configuration: UI5 Server Middleware\n\nIf you require to configure the UI5 server middlewares, you can do so by adding some selected configuration options in the configuration of the middleware in your `ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nspecVersion: \"3.0\"\nmetadata:\n  name: ui5.bookshop\ntype: application\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-middleware-ui5\n      afterMiddleware: compression\n      configuration:\n        modules:\n          %moduleId%:\n            configFile: \"ui5.yaml\",\n            workspaceConfigFile: \"ui5-workspace.yaml\",\n            workspaceName: \"default\",\n            versionOverride: \"1.117.0\"\n```\n\nThe `moduleId` is the `name` from the `package.json`.\n\nThe available configuration options are:\n\n- `configFile`: *`string`* - name of the config file (defaults to \"ui5.yaml\")\n- `workspaceConfigFile`: *`string`* - name of the workspace config file (defaults to \"ui5-workspace.yaml\")\n- `workspaceName`: *`string`* - name of the workspace (defaults to \"default\" when the file at workspaceConfigPath exists)\n- `versionOverride`: *`string`* - Framework version to use instead of the one defined in the root project\n\nIf the `configFile` or `workspaceConfigFile` startes with `./` or `../` then the config file is considered to be relative to the `ui5.yaml`.\n\nThe configuration options from the UI5 server middlewares and the mount path can be mixed together as they both are in the same section of the `ui5.yaml`.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-ui5\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-ui5\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nThe middleware searches for UI5 application projects in the project dependencies and includes them via express routers into the current UI5 development server. The projects will be served via their namespace (from `ui5.yaml`) or the package name (from `package.json`).\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

UI5 middleware for delivering content from JAR files\n\n> :wave: This is a **community project** and there is no official support for this package! Feel free to use it, open issues, contribute, and help answering questions.\n\nMiddleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), delivering the content of JAR files.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Requires at least [`@ui5/cli@3.0.0`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/v3/pages/CLI/) (to support [`specVersion: \"3.0\"`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/pages/Configuration/#specification-version-30))\n\n> :warning: **UI5 CLI Compatibility**\n> All releases of this UI5 CLI extension using the major version `3` require UI5 CLI V3. Any previous releases below major version `3` (if available) also support older versions of the UI5 CLI. But the usage of the latest UI5 CLI is strongly recommended!\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-middleware-webjars --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- classpathFile: `string`\n\n  the file containing the classpath (list of files, separated with the path delimiter) which can be created via:\n\n  > `mvn clean dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.cpFile=target/classpath`\n\n- rootPath: `string`\n\n  the root path to the static resources on your system\n\n- jarRootPath: `string`, default: `META-INF/resources/`\n\n  the root path in the JAR file containing the static resources\n\n- debug: `boolean`, default: `false`\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-webjars\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-webjars\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      rootPath: \"jars\"\n      jarRootPath: \"META-INF/\"\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nThe middleware searches for JAR files in the `rootPath`, loads them and serves the content from JAR files following the web static resources concept of Servlet 3.0 (WebJARs). By default, this allows to consume static resources from the JAR files from within the `META-INF/resources/` path. When using JAR files following a derived web static resources concept it is possible to override the JAR root path with the configuration `jarRootPath`.\n\n```text\njarRootPath: \"META-INF/resources/\"\n\nMETA-INF/resources/my/resource/path/Resource.js => http://localhost:8080/my/resource/path/Resource.js\n\n---\njarRootPath: \"META-INF/\"\n\nMETA-INF/resources/my/resource/path/Resource.js => http://localhost:8080/resources/my/resource/path/Resource.js\n```\n\n## Development\n\nIf you want to contribute to `ui5-middleware-webjars`, please use [`Prettier`](https://prettier.io) for code formatting/style and apply the rules from `./.prettierrc`.

UI5 middleware to enable websockets\n\n> :wave: This is a **community project** and there is no official support for this package! Feel free to use it, open issues, contribute, and help answering questions.\n\nMiddleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server) to demo WebSocket usage with an simple echo service.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Requires at least [`@ui5/cli@3.0.0`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/v3/pages/CLI/) (to support [`specVersion: \"3.0\"`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/pages/Configuration/#specification-version-30))\n\n> :warning: **UI5 CLI Compatibility**\n> All releases of this UI5 CLI extension using the major version `3` require UI5 CLI V3. Any previous releases below major version `3` (if available) also support older versions of the UI5 CLI. But the usage of the latest UI5 CLI is strongly recommended!\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-middleware-websocket --save-dev\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-websocket-echo\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-websocket-echo\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    mountPath: /wsecho\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nThe middleware uses the utility function `websocket` which allows to inject a WebSocket middleware function into a UI5 middleware function:\n\n```js\nconst websocket = require(\"ui5-middleware-websocket/lib/websocket\");\n\n/**\n * WebSocket middleware to act as an echo service.\n *\n * @param {object} parameters Parameters\n * @param {@ui5/logger/Logger} parameters.log Logger instance\n * @returns {Function} Middleware function to use\n */\nmodule.exports = ({ log }) => {\n  return websocket(function echo(ws, req /*, next */) {\n    ws.on(\"message\", function (message) {\n      log.info(`message: ${message}`);\n      ws.send(`echo ${message}`);\n    });\n    log.info(`Connection established with ${req.url}`);\n  });\n};\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

This task is only relevant for standalone applications!\n\n> :wave: This is a **community project** and there is no official support for this package! Feel free to use it, open issues, contribute, and help answering questions.\n\nTask for [ui5-builder](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-builder), enabling cachebusting for standalone applications.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Requires at least [`@ui5/cli@3.0.0`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/v3/pages/CLI/) (to support [`specVersion: \"3.0\"`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/pages/Configuration/#specification-version-30))\n\n> :warning: **UI5 CLI Compatibility**\n> All releases of this UI5 CLI extension using the major version `3` require UI5 CLI V3. Any previous releases below major version `3` (if available) also support older versions of the UI5 CLI. But the usage of the latest UI5 CLI is strongly recommended!\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-task-cachebuster --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- debug: `true|false`\\\nVerbose logging\n- moveResouces: `true|false`\\\ndefault true: moves all the files in the build to a subfolder named `/~timestamp~/`\\\nfalse: no files are moved and no subfolder created\n- excludeFromMove : eg. `[\"index.html\", \"logout.html\"]`\\\nonly relevant if moveResources is `true`\\\ndefault `[\"index.html\"]`: the files which should not be moved into the timestamp subfolder\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-task-cachebuster\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\nWhat is possible:\n```yaml \nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n  - name: ui5-task-cachebuster\n    afterTask: generateResourcesJson\n    configuration:\n      debug: true | false\n      moveResources: true | false\n      excludeFromMove: [\"index.html\", \"logout.html\"]\n```\nFor app in SAP BTP in Cloud Foundry environment with managed approuter:\n```yaml\nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n  - name: ui5-task-cachebuster\n    afterTask: generateResourcesJson\n    configuration:\n      moveResources: false\n```\n\nIf ui5-task-zipper is used you need to include the beforeTask config.\n```yaml\n  - name: ui5-task-cachebuster\n    beforeTask: ui5-task-zipper    \n```\n\n## How it works\n**This is only relevant for standalone applications, not apps that run in SAP Fiori Launchpad**\n\nWhy do we need this? \n\"Cache busting is a way for updates to still happen when using web caching.\"\nTo make sure that the newest deployed changes of the webapp are displayed, even though web caching is used by the client browsers, a cachetoken is added to the paths which point to the static files. This cachetoken is changing for each build, therefore the browser has to reload all resources if the cachetoken has changed.\n\nStandalone apps have to explicitly deal with cachbusting.\n\nThis task can be used to move all files except index.html to a subfolder with the current timestamp as a name. In the index.html the `data-sap-ui-resourceroots` path is updated to include the `/~timestamp~/` path like so: `{\"my.app\": \"./~1234241421~/\"}`.\nThis dynamic cachebusting token ensures that the static resources will have to be reloaded after a new build was deployed.\n\nIf the app is deployed on SAP BTP in the Cloud Foundry environment with the managed approuter, the configuration `moveResources: false` should be used, since the `~token~` in the path to the files will be ignored.\n\nIf you included any other .html files in your project who's path should not change, like a logout.html which is routed to in the xs-app.json, you should add it to the `excludeFromMove` configuration. This takes an array of file paths (relative to webapp folder) which should not be moved into the timestamp subfolder.\n\nUse Cases:\n- Standalone Web-Server:\n  Adapt index.html + Move files into timestamp folder \n- CloudFoundry HTML5 Apps with managed approuter:\n\tJust adapt index.html\n-\tNeo HTML5 Apps:\n\tAdapt index.html + enable cachebuster handling in neo-app.json with ui5CacheBuster: true\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache

UI5 CLI extension for compiling less files\n\n> :wave: This is a **community project** and there is no official support for this package! Feel free to use it, open issues, contribute, and help answering questions.\n\nThe project includes a task for [ui5-builder](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-builder), enabling compiling of less files in your app folder, and a middleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), live compiling less files.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Requires at least [`@ui5/cli@3.0.0`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/v3/pages/CLI/) (to support [`specVersion: \"3.0\"`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/pages/Configuration/#specification-version-30))\n\n> :warning: **UI5 CLI Compatibility**\n> All releases of this UI5 CLI extension using the major version `3` require UI5 CLI V3. Any previous releases below major version `3` (if available) also support older versions of the UI5 CLI. But the usage of the latest UI5 CLI is strongly recommended!\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-tooling-less --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- debug: `true|false`  \n  verbose logging\n\n- lessToCompile `String<Array>` (*task relevant only*)\n  array of less resources specified as paths or glob patterns which should be compiled\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-tooling-less\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\nThe configuration for the custom task:\n\n```yaml\nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n    - name: ui5-tooling-less-task\n      afterTask: replaceVersion\n```\n\nThe configuration for the custom middleware:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-tooling-less-middleware\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nThe UI5 CLI extension can be used to compile less files in your app folder by using [less-openui5](https://github.com/SAP/less-openui5).\n\nIt can also include less file from UI5 library dependencies (framework and custom ones), e.g.:\n\n```less\n@import \"/resources/sap/ui/core/themes/base/base.less\";\n```\n\nTo get all the less variable that are defined in the sap ui theme core, or, e.g.:\n\n```less\n@import \"/resources/ui5/ecosystem/showcase/lib/css/variables.less\";\n```\n\nImportant is that every less resources imported from outside the application project must use the runtime path (e.g. `/resources/%project_namespace%/...`) and all local less files can be imported with relative paths (e.g. `./base/base.less`).\n\nThe task derives the available less files from the manifest (section: `sap.ui5/resources/css`) unless you specify a glob pattern in the task configuration to include e.g. all less resources:\n\n```yaml\nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n    - name: ui5-tooling-less-task\n      afterTask: replaceVersion\n      configuration:\n        lessToCompile:\n          - \"**/*.less\" # \"css/style.less\"\n```\n\n> :information_source: The css file corresponding to your less file needs to be maintained in the manifest as described [here](https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/723f4b2334e344c08269159797f6f796).\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

Feel free to use it, open issues, contribute, and help answering questions.\n\nTask for [ui5-builder](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-builder), to prepare build result for deployment to SAP NetWeaver.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Requires at least [`@ui5/cli@3.0.0`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/v3/pages/CLI/) (to support [`specVersion: \"3.0\"`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/pages/Configuration/#specification-version-30))\n\n> :warning: **UI5 CLI Compatibility**\n> All releases of this UI5 CLI extension using the major version `3` require UI5 CLI V3. Any previous releases below major version `3` (if available) also support older versions of the UI5 CLI. But the usage of the latest UI5 CLI is strongly recommended!\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\n# Using npm\nnpm install ui5-task-flatten-library --save-dev\n\n# Using pnpm\npnpm add --save-dev ui5-task-flatten-library\n\n# Using yarn\nyarn add --dev ui5-task-flatten-library\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-task-flatten-library\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n    - name: ui5-task-flatten-library\n      afterTask: generateResourcesJson\n\n```\n\n## How it works\n\n- For `src` files it removes the `/resources/${projectNamespace}/` part of the path (e.g. `dist/resources/my/lib/library.js` => `dist/library.js`)\n- All `test` files (`/test-resources/`) will be omitted from the build result\n- A warning is logged for `src` files that are not part of the project namespace\n\n## UI5 CLI Output Style\n\nStarting from `@ui5/cli` version 3.8.0, the UI5 CLI introduces a new build option known as \"Output Style.\" This feature allows developers to switch between various output styles when building their projects. Now you have the flexibility to omit both this project namespace and the “resources” directory. Imagine “/resources/sap/m/RangeSlider.js” transforming into “./RangeSlider.js.” This results in a flat build output.  \nThe available output styles include:\n\n- `Default`: The default directory structure for every project type. For applications, this is identical to \"Flat\", and for libraries, it is \"Namespace\". Other types have a more distinct default output style.\n- `Flat`: Omits the project namespace and the \"resources\" directory.\n- `Namespace`: Respects the project namespace and the \"resources\" directory, maintaining the original structure.\n\nTo learn more about this feature and to migrate your project to the native Output Style feature instead of using the custom task, refer to the [associated blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/?p=1898173?source=email-global-notification-bp-new-in-tag-followed) or the [CLI documentation page](https://ui5.github.io/cli/stable/pages/CLI/#ui5-build).\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

UI5 task for minifying XML resources (like views, fragments, etc.)\n\n> :wave: This is a **community project** and there is no official support for this package! Feel free to use it, open issues, contribute, and help answering questions.\n\nTask for [ui5-builder](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-builder), enabling XML minification based on [minify-xml](https://github.com/kristian/minify-xml#readme).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Requires at least [`@ui5/cli@3.0.0`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/v3/pages/CLI/) (to support [`specVersion: \"3.0\"`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/pages/Configuration/#specification-version-30))\n\n> :warning: **UI5 CLI Compatibility**\n> All releases of this UI5 CLI extension using the major version `3` require UI5 CLI V3. Any previous releases below major version `3` (if available) also support older versions of the UI5 CLI. But the usage of the latest UI5 CLI is strongly recommended!\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-task-minify-xml --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- minifyOptions: `Object`\n  all options available from the [minify-xml](https://github.com/kristian/minify-xml#options) plugin, with one additional (non-compliant) `collapseWhitespaceInAttributeValues` (`boolean`) option, due to UI5 having a lot of options (e.g. with JSON values) where collapsing whitespace is beneficial. defaults to all standard options of `minify-xml` and `collapseWhitespaceInAttributeValues` enabled.\n\n- fileExtensions: `String|Array<String>`\n  the file extensions to glob for. defaults to `xml`.\n\n- excludePatterns: `Array<String>` \n  array of paths inside `$yourapp/` to exclude from the minification, e.g. 3-rd party libs in `lib/*`. defaults to an empty array `[]`.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-task-minify-xml\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n  - name: ui5-task-minify-xml\n    afterTask: replaceVersion\n    configuration:\n      minifyOptions:\n        removeComments: true\n

UI5 task for turning a UI5 App into a PWA\n\n> :wave: This is a **community project** and there is no official support for this package! Feel free to use it, open issues, contribute, and help answering questions.\n\nProgressive Web Apps are web applications that have been designed to be capable, reliable, and installable. These three pillars transform them into an experience that feels like a platform-specific application. Interested? Find out more here: [What are Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)?](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Requires at least [`@ui5/cli@3.0.0`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/v3/pages/CLI/) (to support [`specVersion: \"3.0\"`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/pages/Configuration/#specification-version-30))\n\n> :warning: **UI5 CLI Compatibility**\n> All releases of this UI5 CLI extension using the major version `3` require UI5 CLI V3. Any previous releases below major version `3` (if available) also support older versions of the UI5 CLI. But the usage of the latest UI5 CLI is strongly recommended!\n\n## Install\n\n`npm install ui5-task-pwa-enabler --save-dev`\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\nIf you are familiar with jsonschema check out the config.json.\n\n### `serviceWorker`\n\n`strategy`\n\nDefines how the service worker should behave. Possible values are\n\n* `Offline-Page` The App will display a offline page when it cannot connect to the internet. Requires `offlinePage` parameter.\n* `Offline-Copy` While browsing the App, the Service Worker captures all files and stores them in the cache.\n* `Offline-Copy-With-Backup-Page` A combination of the above two. Requires `offlinePage` parameter.\n* `Cache-First` This option pre-caches all given files and serves them from the cache first. Requires `preCacheFiles` parameter.\n* `Advanced-Caching` With this option you have very granular control about which files should be cached, and which shouldn't. Requires all of the parameters below.\n\n`offlinePage`: Sets the page that will be shown if the user is offline, should be a `.html` file somewhere in your project. Only required for `Offline-Page`, `Offline-Copy-With-Backup-Page`, `Advanced-Caching`.\n\n`preCache`: List of [glob pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) that match the files that will be pre cached when the application starts. Only required for `Cache-First` and `Advanced-Caching` strategies.\n\n`preCachePrefix`:  Prefix for all the files determined using `preCache`. Useful in scenario where application is deployed at a centralized runtime infrastructure e.g. Mangaged Approuter provided by SAP Build Work Zone. Only applicable for `Advanced-Caching` & `Cache-First` strategies.\n\n`networkFirst`: List of regular expressions, everything that matches any of the expressions will be fetched from the network first and only served from cache when there is no network available. Only required for `Advanced-Caching`.\n\n`avoidCaching`: List of regular expressions, everything that matches any of the expressions won't be cached. Only required for `Advanced-Caching`\n\n### `manifest`\n\nWhatever you supply here will be copied to the `manifest.webmanifest` file, you can read more about it at [web.dev](https://web.dev/add-manifest/). If a required parameter is missing a default value will be provided.\n\nAnother special parameter `crossOrigin` is supported as part of `manifest` configuration. However, it is not copied to `manifest.webmanifest`, instead added to  `<link>` while changing the `index.html`.\n\n  `crossOrigin`: The request for the manifest is made without credentials, even if it's on the same domain. If the manifest requires credentials, add this parameter and provide value **use-credentials**.\n\n## Usage\n\n### 1. Define the dependency in your `package.json`\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    \"ui5-task-pwa-enabler\": \"*\"\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Configure it in your `ui5.yaml`\n\nThis is a example configuration for an advanced service worker and some custom manifest parameters.\n\n```yaml\nspecVersion: \"3.0\"\nmetadata:\n  name: openui5-sample-app\ntype: application\nresources:\n  configuration:\n    propertiesFileSourceEncoding: \"UTF-8\"\nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n    - name: ui5-task-pwa-enabler\n      afterTask: generateVersionInfo\n      configuration:\n        serviceWorker:\n          strategy: Advanced-Caching\n          offlinePage: offline.html\n          preCache:\n            - \"controller/*\"\n            - \"*.html\"\n            - \"view/*\"\n            - \"images/*\"\n          networkFirst:\n            - /\\/api\\/.*/\n          avoidCaching:\n            - /\\/realtime-api\\/.*/\n        manifest:\n          short_name: To-Do App\n          name: To-Do App\n          description: Sample to-do-app for testing pwaEnabler\n          icons:\n            - src: images/SAP_R_192.png\n              type: image/png\n              sizes: 192x192\n            - src: images/SAP_R_512.png\n              type: image/png\n              sizes: 512x512\n          start_url: /index.html\n          scope: /\n          background_color: \"#EFF4F9\"\n          theme_color: \"#3F5161\"\n          display: standalone\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nUnder the hood we are using the examples from the [pwabuilder](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwabuilder-serviceworkers)\nbut we replaced the configuration part with templating and generate those values from the provided configuration.\nAdditionally we have to inject a few lines into the `index.html` to make sure everything is linked and tadaa, you have\nyour own fancy PWA.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

UI5 task for zipping all project resources\n\n> :wave: This is a **community project** and there is no official support for this package! Feel free to use it, open issues, contribute, and help answering questions.\n\nTask for [ui5-builder](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-builder), enabling zipping.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Requires at least [`@ui5/cli@3.0.0`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/v3/pages/CLI/) (to support [`specVersion: \"3.0\"`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/pages/Configuration/#specification-version-30))\n\n> :warning: **UI5 CLI Compatibility**\n> All releases of this UI5 CLI extension using the major version `3` require UI5 CLI V3. Any previous releases below major version `3` (if available) also support older versions of the UI5 CLI. But the usage of the latest UI5 CLI is strongly recommended!\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-task-zipper --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- debug: `true|false`\nVerbose logging\n\n- archiveName: `String`\nDesired name for the `.zip` archive.\nDefault value: `<app-id.zip>`\n\n- additionalFiles: `String<Array>` or `Object<Array>`\nList of files to be included in the ZIP archive relative to the project root or Map of of files to be included in the ZIP archive relative to the project root and target path in the ZIP archive.\n\n- onlyZip: `true|false`\nSet this to `true` to omit the resources contained in the ZIP from the build result (typically in the `dist` folder). By default, the build result contains all resources and the ZIP.\n\n- includeDependencies: `true|false` or `String<Array>`\nSet this to `true` if you also want to include the dependencies (UI5 libraries) in the zip archive. Otherwise, it will only include the workspace files (controller, views, etc). In order to select only specific dependencies to be included in the final zip you just need to specify the list of dependencies (value of `ui5.yaml`: `metadata > name`).\n\n- relativePaths `true|false`\nSet this to `true` if you want to turn absolute data source paths in the `manifest.json` into relative paths, e.g. `\"uri\": \"/backend/\"` will be turned into `\"uri\": \"backend/\"` upon ZIP creation. This is useful when deploying the ZIP to the HTML Application Repository on SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment to later consume it in SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition, which only supports relative paths.\n\n**NOTE:** Starting with release `3.0.5`, the `ui5-task-zipper` includes the generated workspace resources such as the self-contained bundles (`sap-ui-custom.*` files). To do so, it is important that the `ui5-task-zipper` is running as last task in the build.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-task-zipper\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n  - name: ui5-task-zipper\n    afterTask: generateVersionInfo\n    configuration:\n      archiveName: \"webapp\"\n      additionalFiles:\n        \"app/foo/xs-app.json\":      # source path will be used as target path\n        \"path/to/foo.js\": \"foo.js\"  # file will be placed in root of ZIP file\n        \"path/to/files/bar.js\": \"some/custom/dir/bar.js\"\n```\n\n### Select the dependencies to include\n\nWith the configuration option `includeDependencies` you can also specifiy a list of dependencies to be included in the zip file. To do so, specify a list of dependencies using their `ui5.yaml`: `metadata > name` property:\n\n```yaml\nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n  - name: ui5-task-zipper\n    afterTask: generateVersionInfo\n    configuration:\n      includeDependencies:\n      - sap.ui.table\n      - ui5.ecosystem.demo.lib\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nThe task can be used to zip all project resources in an archive.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

UI5 CLI Extensions for NPM Package Consumption\n\n> :wave: This is a **community project** and there is no official support for this package! Feel free to use it, open issues, contribute, and help answering questions.\n\nThe UI5 CLI extensions include a custom middleware and a custom task which allow to use NPM package names for AMD-like dependencies, e.g.:\n\n```bash\n# Install a dev dependency to Chart.js (https://www.chartjs.org/)\nnpm install chart.js\n```\n\n```js\n// use Chart.js as a AMD-like dependency\nsap.ui.define([\n  \"chart.js\"\n], function(chartjs) {\n  [...]\n  alert(chartjs.version);\n  [...]\n})\n```\n\nOnce the UI5 application is finally built, the Chart.js dependency will be copied into the `dist/resources` folder with the proper namespace. In case of Chart.js above, there is no namespace and thus the location will be `dist/resources/chart.js.js`.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Requires at least [`@ui5/cli@3.0.0`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/v3/pages/CLI/) (to support [`specVersion: \"3.0\"`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/pages/Configuration/#specification-version-30))\n\n> :warning: **UI5 CLI Compatibility**\n> All releases of this UI5 CLI extension using the major version `3` require UI5 CLI V3. Any previous releases below major version `3` (if available) also support older versions of the UI5 CLI. But the usage of the latest UI5 CLI is strongly recommended!\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-tooling-modules --save-dev\n```\n\nIf you want the `ui5-tooling-modules` to add it's configuration to the UI5 YAML files, just add the command line argument `-rte` or `--register-tooling-extension`:\n\n```bash\n# Register in default file (ui5.yaml if it exists)\nnpm install ui5-tooling-modules --save-dev -rte\n\n# Register in specific YAML files\nnpm install ui5-tooling-modules --save-dev -rte ui5.yaml,ui5-workspace.yaml\n\n# Register in custom YAML files\nnpm install ui5-tooling-modules --save-dev -rte my-ui5.yaml,custom-workspace.yaml\n```\n\nWhen using `-rte` without specifying files, the extension will automatically register itself in `ui5.yaml` if it exists in the project directory. \n\nWhen specifying file names (comma-separated), the extension will only register in those specific files.\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\nThe following configuration options are relevant for the `task` and the `middleware`:\n\n- *debug*: `boolean|string`\n  Enables debug logging (defaults to `false`), by setting value to `\"verbose\"` the extension will log even more detailed\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *skipCache*: `boolean`\n  For development scenarios, the module cache can be disabled by setting this option to true. Normally, if a module changes (e.g. bundledefs), this change is detected and the bundle is recreated. This just forces the regeneration always (defaults to `false`)\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *persistentCache*: `boolean` *experimental feature*\n  With this option, the bundle information will be persistent and will be available again after the restart of the development server or for the next execution of your build task. The bundle information is stored in the working directory in the folder `.ui5-tooling-modules` folder. It's recommended to put this folder into `.gitignore` (defaults to `false`)\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *keepDynamicImports*: `boolean|String[]` *experimental feature*\n  An arrays of NPM package names for which the dynamic imports with a generic target module (e.g. `import(anyUrl)`) will not be converted into a `require` based polyfill. If the value is a boolean, it activates/deactivates the feature for all modules (by default it is active!). This experimental feature is useful in scenarios loading ES modules dynamically from generic URLs. All dynamic imports resolving a concrete module (e.g. `import(\"jspdf\")`) will be converted into chunks and loaded with a `require` call.\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *skipTransform*: `boolean|String[]` *experimental feature*\n  Array of glob patterns to verify whether the module transformation should be skipped for the modules which are matching the glob pattern. If the value is a `boolean` then the transformation can be skipped in general by setting the value to `true`. The configuration can be incorporated from the `customConfiguration` of a dependency using that middleware, e.g. a library can provide its `customConfiguration` for the application project like this (and can reuse the configuration internally via [YAML anchors](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#692-node-anchors)):\n  ```yaml\n  specVersion: \"3.0\"\n  metadata:\n    name: com.myorg.mylib\n  type: library\n  customConfiguration:\n    ui5-tooling-modules: &cfgModules\n      skipTransform:\n        - \"@luigi-project/container/dist/anypath/**\"\n  builder:\n    customTasks:\n      - name: ui5-tooling-modules-task\n        afterTask: replaceVersion\n        configuration:\n          <<: *cfgModules\n  ```\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *inject*: `Map<String, String|String[]>` *experimental feature*\n  A map of Globals which are injected as imports to an NPM package to handle cases in which functions need to be poly- or ponyfilled. The configuration is aligned with definition of the Globals in the [@rollup/plugin-inject](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-inject):\n  ```yaml\n  configuration:\n    inject:\n      # import setImmediate from 'set-immediate-shim'\n      setImmediate: set-immediate-shim\n      # import { Promise } from 'es6-promise'\n      Promise:\n        - es6-promise\n        - Promise\n      # import { Promise as P } from 'es6-promise'\n      P:\n        - es6-promise\n        - Promise\n      # import $ from 'jquery'\n      $: jquery\n      # import * as fs from 'fs'\n      fs:\n        - 'fs'\n        - '*'\n  ```\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *legacyDependencyResolution*: `boolean`\n  Re-enables the legacy dependency resolution of the UI5 CLI extension which allows to use entry points from `devDependencies` of the project. By default, only the `dependencies` maintained in the projects' `package.json` and the transitive dependencies are considered for the entry points and all other entry points are ignored. (available since new minor version `3.7.0` which introduces a new dependency resolution for `dependencies` only)\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *additionalDependencies*: `string[]`\n  List of additional dependency names to include into the bundling. By default all dependencies and their transitive dependencies are considered. In some cases it is useful to also include devDependencies, e.g. when re-packaging a thirdparty package. If you want to exclude this dependency from being a transitive dependency then you can put it into the devDependencies and list it in this configuration option (but keep in mind that this may exclude the dependency from some check tools!)\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *entryPoints*: `string[]` *experimental feature*\n  List of entry point modules to include into the bundling. By default the entry point modules are discovered from the sources (`*.ts`, `*.tsx`, `*.js`, `*.jsx`, `*.xml`)\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *minify*: `boolean` *experimental feature*\n  Flag to indicate that the generated code should be minified (in case of excluding thirdparty resources from minification in general, this option can be used to minify just the generated code)\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *sourcemap*: `boolean` *experimental feature*\n  Flag to indicate that the sourcemap generation should be enabled. By default the option is diabled. Possible values are `true`, `false`, `\"inline\"`, and `hidden`.\n  &nbsp;\n\nThe following configuration options are relevant for the `task` and the `middleware` which allow you to directly configure rollup plugins which is used as follows:\n\n```yaml\n  configuration:\n    pluginOptions:   # map of plugin options\n      webcomponents: # the name of the rollup plugin\n        skip: true   # configuration\n```\n\nThe available plugin configuration options are:\n\n- *pluginOptions.webcomponents.skip*: `boolean`\n  Flag to skip the transformation of Web Components to UI5 Controls a.k.a. *Seamless Web Components* support. This allows to directly require the Web Components modules from NPM packages and use them as UI5 Controls. The NPM packages providing Web Components must include a [Custom Elements Manifest](https://custom-elements-manifest.open-wc.org/) declared in the `customElements` field in the `package.json`. (defaults to `false`)\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *pluginOptions.webcomponents.force*: `boolean`\n  Flag to force the transformation of Web Components to UI5 Controls a.k.a. *Seamless Web Components* support. In some cases, in which the framework version cannot be part of the `ui5.yaml`, you can force the transformation. (defaults to `true`)\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *pluginOptions.webcomponents.scoping*: `boolean`\n  Flag to disable the [Custom Elements Scoping](https://ui5.github.io/webcomponents/docs/advanced/scoping/) of UI5 Web Components. This allows to load multiple versions of UI5 Web Components into a single application without conflicts. This feature is enabled by default and can be disabled if needed. (defaults to `true`)\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *pluginOptions.webcomponents.namespace*: `boolean|string`\n  Defines the relative namespace for the Web Components modules (defaults to `\"gen\"`). If disabled, using the boolean value `false`, the Web Components modules are put into the namespace specified by `addToNamespace`. This is also relevant due to the JSDoc generation to allow a proper exclusion of the nested 3rd party namespace which could cause issues during the JSDoc build. The Web Components modules in the `gen` namespace are safe to be processed by the JSDoc generator to enable the generation of the API docu for the Web Components modules.\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *pluginOptions.webcomponents.enrichBusyIndicator*: `boolean` *experimental flag*\n  Flag to include the BusyIndicator support from into the generated Web Components package module. (defaults to `false`)\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *pluginOptions.webcomponents.includeAssets*: `boolean` *experimental flag*\n  Flag to include all assets into the thirdparty folder: such as all themes and languages. Although they will be lazily loaded the generation process will slow down and you will have many additional files. All dynamic imports will reside inside the `_dynamics` folder within the thirdparty folder. (defaults to `false`)\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *pluginOptions.webcomponents.skipJSDoc*: `boolean` *experimental flag*\n  Flag to enable/disable the generation of the JSDoc for the UI5 control wrappers. (defaults to `true` until the feature is fully implemented, in future `false`)\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *pluginOptions.webcomponents.skipDtsGeneration*: `boolean` *experimental flag*\n  Flag to enable/disable the generation of the *.d.ts files for the UI5 control wrappers, enabling basic TypeScript support. (defaults to `true` until the feature is fully implemented, in future `false`)\n  &nbsp;\n\nThe following configuration options are just relevant for the `task`:\n\n- *prependPathMappings*: `boolean`\n  Prepends the path mappings for the UI5 loader to the `Component.js` which allows to run the Component using 3rd party modules in e.g. Fiori launchpad environments (defaults to `false`)\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *addToNamespace*: `boolean|string`\n  Puts 3rd party modules into the namespace of the Component to make them Component-local. All used 3rd party modules will be moved by default into the sub-namespace `thirdparty` of the Component namespace at build time. If you use a string as value of `addToNamespace` you can define a custom namespace, e.g. `my/namespace/for/libs` which will be nested in the Components' namespace. With that option you can run your application using 3rd party modules in a Fiori launchpad environment. In some cases (wrong dependency rewrite, wish to keep 3rd party modules in the `resources` path, ...) it might be necessary to disable this option. (defaults to `true`, disables *prependPathMappings* when set to `true`)\n  &nbsp;\n  > :warning: While this works great for any non-UI5 3rd party module, there are limitations for the consumption of UI5 modules from custom control 3rd party modules (NPM packages). The UI5 module names (used for `Object.extend(...)`, aggregation types, ...) are not rewritten and this may cause issues. UI5 assumes that the used module path (slash syntax) is matching the module name (dot syntax). This can lead to issues for `Object.isA(...)` checks, Renderer lookups (when not inlined or referenced by module), or for any other API which derives the module name from the module path or vice versa. If you encounter such issues you may consider to disable the option and instruct the loader via `sap.ui.loader.config({ paths: ... })` to load the resources properly.\n\n- *removeScopePrefix*: `boolean`\n  Removes the scope prefix `@` from the namespace/path of the 3rd party module when adding it to the namespace with the *addToNamespace* option.\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *sanitizeNpmPackageName*: `boolean`\n  Sanitizes the NPM package name from the namespace/path of the 3rd party module when adding it to the namespace with the *addToNamespace* option. This option overrides and enables the `removeScopePrefix` option to remove the leading `@` and all `-` characters are converted to `_`. This is necessary to support the JSDoc generation for Web Components properly.\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *providedDependencies*: `String[]`\n  An array of NPM package names which will be available in the development server via the middleware but will be ignored for the build process via the task. Provided dependencies are considered as being provided by the application runtime rather than it must be shipped with the current project. Provided dependencies will ignore any of the configurations above.\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *includeAssets*: `Map<String, String[]>` *experimental feature*\n  A map of NPM package names to list of glob patterns which defines the assets to be included. The list of glob patterns can be omitted in case of copying all resources of the NPM package.\n  &nbsp;\n\nThe following configuration options are just relevant for the `middleware`:\n\n- *useRelativeModulePaths*: `boolean` *experimental flag*\n  Usually, the middleware converts the module paths to absolute modules paths relative to the `application` project. In some special cases, in which the application doesn't register its namespace in the start page, it is better to use relative module paths for the local development (e.g. the UI5 testsuite application serving many test pages for different controls). For `library` projects this option is always turned on as for library projects they are not served in the root context of the server, they are also served via the `resources` + namespace URL.\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *watch*: `boolean|String[]` *experimental flag*\n  For development scenarios, the server is listening to changes of the source files of the project and its dependencies and triggers the generation of the bundle if the used NPM packages have been changed (defaults to `true`) - additionally, you can pass a list of folders or files to watch for changes for special cases\n  &nbsp;\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-tooling-modules\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n2. Configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\nThe configuration for the custom task:\n\n```yaml\nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n    - name: ui5-tooling-modules-task\n      afterTask: replaceVersion\n```\n\nThe configuration for the custom middleware:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-tooling-modules-middleware\n      afterMiddleware: compression\n```\n\n> :warning: In case your application is using a proxy such `fiori-tools-proxy`, the proxy must run after `ui5-tooling-modules-middleware` middleware. Otherwise proxy will try to serve the resources for your installed npm package instead of `ui5-tooling-modules-middleware`. You can achieve this by setting `afterMiddleware: ui5-tooling-modules-middleware` in `fiori-tools-proxy` middleware.\n\n---\n:fire: **TIP** :fire:\n\n[YAML anchors](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#692-node-anchors) are a great feature to avoid redundancies in `.yaml` files. You can share the configuration of the `task` and the `middleware` in the following way:\n\n**`ui5.yaml`**\n```yaml\ncustomConfiguration:\n  ui5-tooling-modules: &cfgModules\n    debug: true\n    keepDynamicImports:\n      - \"@luigi-project/container\"\n[...]\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-tooling-modules-middleware\n      afterMiddleware: compression\n      configuration:\n        <<: *cfgModules\n[...]\nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n    - name: ui5-tooling-modules-task\n      afterTask: replaceVersion\n      configuration:\n        <<: *cfgModules\n        addToNamespace: true\n```\n\nWith this approach you can ensure that you have a consistent configuration across your `task` and `middleware`.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\nThe custom middleware is listening to incoming requests and checks those requests to match npm packages. E.g. a dependency to `chart.js` will cause a request to `resource/chart.js.js`. The middleware now derives the module name which is `\"chart.js\"` and uses `require.resolve(\"chart.js\")` to lookup the npm package for it. If an npm package exists, the middleware is using `rollup` to create a custom AMD bundle for the npm package which uses `sap.ui.define` instead of `define`.\n\nThe custom task is scanning all AMD dependencies of all modules and tries to resolve the module names. If a module has been found a custom bundle will be created in the proper namespace of the module, e.g. `@apollo/client/core` will create a custom bundle at `dist/resources/@apollo/client/core.js`.\n\n## How to obtain support\n\nPlease use the GitHub bug tracking system to post questions, bug reports or to create pull requests.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAny type of contribution (code contributions, pull requests, issues) to this showcase will be equally appreciated.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

UI5 CLI Extension for Replacing Strings\n\n> :wave: This is a **community project** and there is no official support for this package! Feel free to use it, open issues, contribute, and help answering questions.\n\nTask and Middleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), doing a string replace on files matched by the `files` configuration option.\n\n> :information_source: The middleware hooks into the response to intercept the headers and the data allowing to replace the strings matching the `replace` patterns. Therefore, the middleware must run before other middlewares which end the middleware chain (not calling `next()`).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Requires at least [`@ui5/cli@3.0.0`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/v3/pages/CLI/) (to support [`specVersion: \"3.0\"`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/pages/Configuration/#specification-version-30))\n\n> :warning: **UI5 CLI Compatibility**\n> All releases of this UI5 CLI extension using the major version `3` require UI5 CLI V3. Any previous releases below major version `3` (if available) also support older versions of the UI5 CLI. But the usage of the latest UI5 CLI is strongly recommended!\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\n# Using npm\nnpm install ui5-tooling-stringreplace --save-dev\n\n# Using pnpm\npnpm add --save-dev ui5-tooling-stringreplace\n\n# Using yarn\nyarn add --dev ui5-tooling-stringreplace\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- debug: true|false  \n  verbose logging\n- files: `string`|`array`  \n  Placeholders will be replaced with their values in files matched by this glob pattern\n- replace: `array`  \n  List of placeholder, value pairs\n- separator: `string`\n  separator for stringreplace placeholder\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-tooling-stringreplace\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n    - name: ui5-tooling-stringreplace-task\n      afterTask: replaceVersion\n      configuration:\n        files:\n          - \"**/*.js\"\n          - \"**/*.xml\"\n        replace:\n          - placeholder: ${project.artifactId}\n            value: my.sample.app\n          - placeholder: ${project.version}\n            value: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT\n          - placeholder: \"{{app.AppTitle}}\"\n            value: My Sample App\n\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-tooling-stringreplace-middleware\n      afterMiddleware: compression\n      configuration:\n        debug: true\n        prefix: UI5_ENV # default\n        path: ./ # default\n        separator: \".\" # default\n        files:\n          - \"**/*.js\"\n          - \"**/*.xml\"\n        replace:\n          - placeholder: ${project.artifactId}\n            value: my.sample.app\n          - placeholder: ${project.version}\n            value: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT\n          - placeholder: \"{{app.AppTitle}}\"\n            value: My Sample App\n```\n\n3. Maintain all string placeholders and values in `.env` file\n\n```env\nstringreplace.BASE_URL_PLACEHOLDER = http://localhost:2000\nstringreplace.some.deeply.nested.ANOTHER_PLACEHOLDER = Replace with this text\n```\n\n## Multiple environments\n\nYou can keep multiple `.env` files and load a specific environment at build or serve time.\n\n```\n- dev.env\n- staging.env\n- prod.env\n- package.json\n```\n\nYou can define our own prefix in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml` using configuration `prefix` otherwise will default to `UI5_ENV`.\n\nYou can specify the `<UI5_ENV>.env` location by setting the `path` property in the configuration. Default path fallback is set to `./` to find the `<UI5_ENV>.env` file in the same location as the executed `package.json` file.  \n\n```json\n \"scripts\": {\n    \"build:dev\": \"UI5_ENV=dev ui5 build\",\n    \"build:staging\": \"UI5_ENV=staging ui5 build\",\n    \"build:prod\": \"UI5_ENV=prod ui5 build\",\n }\n```\n\nWith `UI5_ENV` set, the strings will be loaded from the `<UI5_ENV>.env` file.\n\nYou can define our own separator in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml` using configuration `separator` otherwise will default to `.`. In case of separator set to `_` placeholder will be `stringreplace_`\n\n## How it works\n\n### Task\n\nThe task reads all files based on configuration patterns and replaces all string placeholders with values for all files. All the string placeholders which are maintained in the process environment with prefix 'stringreplace.' will be taken into account. If no environment name is set through the process environment variable UI5_ENV, then by default the file`./.env` is loaded.\n\n### Middleware\n\nThe middleware replaces the placeholders with their values in the files matched by the patterns. All the string placeholders which are maintained in the process environment with prefix 'stringreplace.' will be taken into account. If no environment name is set through the process environment variable UI5_ENV, then by default the file`./.env` is loaded.\n\nTechnically, the middleware intercepts the response for all requests matching the `files` glob patterns. The middleware must be inserted very early into the middlware chain as it intercepts the `res.writeHead`, `res.write`, and `res.end` functions to collect the response data and to finally replace the placeholders in that data. When using the middleware in combination with e.g. the `ui5-tooling-transpile`, the `ui5-tooling-stringreplace` must be added before the transpile middleware to inject the response hooks.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

UI5 CLI Extension for Transpiling JS/TS\n\n> :wave: This is a **community project** and there is no official support for this package! Feel free to use it, open issues, contribute, and help answering questions.\n\nThe UI5 CLI extension provides a middleware and a task which transpiles JavaScript or TypeScript code to ES5 by using Babel. A default Babel configuration will be provided by the UI5 CLI extension unless a inline Babel configuration in the `ui5.yaml` or any Babel configuration as described at [Babel config files](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files) will be provided.\n\nThe middleware handles by default all requests to `.js`-files. For JavaScript transpilation the matching `.js`-file or for TypeScript the matching `.ts`-file will be transpiled on-the-fly via Babel. The transpiled JavaScript file will inline the `sourcemap`. Because of the `sourcemap`, setting breakpoints in the **original (ES6+ or TS) source** will cause the debugger to stop **when the corresponding transpiled source code is reached**.\n\nThe task finally transpiles the relevant source files during the UI5 CLI build process. In case of TypeScript is enabled, for libraries, the task also generates the `d.ts`-files. For applications, this option can be enabled on demand.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Requires at least [`@ui5/cli@3.0.0`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/v3/pages/CLI/) (to support [`specVersion: \"3.0\"`](https://ui5.github.io/cli/pages/Configuration/#specification-version-30))\n\n> :warning: **UI5 CLI Compatibility**\n> All releases of this UI5 CLI extension using the major version `3` require UI5 CLI V3. Any previous releases below major version `3` (if available) also support older versions of the UI5 CLI. But the usage of the latest UI5 CLI is strongly recommended!\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-tooling-transpile --save-dev\n```\n\nIf you want the `ui5-tooling-transpile` to add it's configuration to the `ui5.yaml`, just add the command line argument `-rte` or `--register-tooling-extension`:\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-tooling-transpile --save-dev -rte\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- debug: `boolean`  \n  enable detailed logging (can be even more verbose by using the `--verbose` argument)\n\n- babelConfig: `String|Object`\n  path to the babel config file or object to use as configuration for babel instead of the babel configuration from the file system (as described at [Babel config files](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files)), or the default configuration defined in this middleware (just using the `@babel/preset-env`)\n\n- includes: `String<Array>` (old alias: includePatterns)\n  array of paths your application to include in transpilation, e.g. `/modern-stuff/`\n\n- excludes: `String<Array>` (old alias: excludePatterns)\n  array of paths your application to exclude from transpilation, e.g. 3-rd party libs in `/lib/`\n\n- filePattern: `String`\n  source file pattern for the resources to transpile, defaults to `.js` and will be changed to `.ts` if a `tsconfig.json` file is located in the project or by explicitly setting the configuration option transformTypeScript to `true` (multiple file extensions can be handled by specifying mutliple extensions using the glob syntax, e.g.: `.+(js|jsx)` or `.+(ts|tsx)`)\n\n- transformTypeScript: `boolean` (old alias: transpileTypeScript)\n  if enabled, the UI5 CLI extension transforms TypeScript sources; the default value is derived from the existence of a `tsconfig.json` in the root folder of the project - if the file exists the configuration option is `true` otherwise `false`; setting this configuration option overrules the automatic determination\n\n- altTsConfig: `String`\n  specify the location of an alternate `tsconfig.json` to use for the TypeScript transpilation step. Also the detection whether the project uses TypeScript is then using the alternate `tsconfig.json` file\n\n- generateTsInterfaces: `boolean|undefined` (*experimental feature*)\n  option requires a dependency to the `@ui5/ts-interface-generator` when either the value of the option is `true` or `undefined` and the project is a TypeScript-based project or the `transformTypeScript` option is set to `true` - can be forced to be inactive by setting the option to `false` (only relevant for the middleware)\n\n- generateTsInterfacesJsDoc: `String(none|minimal|verbose)` (*experimental feature*)\n  configures the amount of JSDoc which should be generated by the `@ui5/ts-interface-generator`. For details please check: <https://github.com/SAP/ui5-typescript/tree/main/packages/ts-interface-generator#commandline-options>\n\n- generateDts: `boolean`\n  if enabled, the UI5 CLI extension will generate type definitions (`.d.ts`) files; by default for projects of type `library` this option is considered as `true` and for other projects such as `application` this option is considered as `false` by default (is only relevant in case of transformTypeScript is `true`)\n\n- failOnDtsErrors: `boolean`\n  if enabled, the UI5 CLI extension will fail during the generation of type definitions (`.d.ts`) files; this option is considered as `false` by default (is only relevant in case of generateDts is `true`)\n\n- omitTSFromBuildResult: `boolean`\n  if enabled, the TypeScript sources will be omitted from the build result. This will disable the debugging support in the TypeScript sources (since the related source files aren't included anymore)\n\n- omitSourceMaps: `boolean`\n  if enabled, the SourceMaps will not be generated for the JavaScript sources created from the TypeScript sources\n\n- transpileDependencies: `boolean` (*experimental feature*)\n  if enabled, the middleware also transpile the sources from the dependencies which is needed for development scenarios when referring to other projects (this configuration option is ignored by the task)\n\n- transformAtStartup: `boolean` (*experimental feature*)\n  if enabled, the resources will be transpiled at startup to avoid additional overhead for the first requests to the transpiled resources.\n\n- skipBabelPresetPluginResolve: `boolean` (*experimental feature*)\n  if enabled, the babel presets and plugins will not be resolved by the UI5 CLI extension and babel itself will do it. This can cause babel presets or plugins not to be found in case of working in monorepos\n\n- generateBabelConfig: `boolean|string` (*experimental feature*)\n  this option allows to generate the babel config file for the current project when the babel config file doesn't exist - this option is useful when you are using babel generation within a different tooling (like a native babel execution inside e.g. jest) to use the same configuration like when running the task or middleware; if the value is a string the UI5 CLI extension will assume to generate a file with the provided name\n\nThe following configuration options will only be taken into account if no inline babel configuration is maintained in the `ui5.yaml` as `babelConfig` or no external babel configuration exists in any configuration file as described in [Babels configuration section](https://babeljs.io/docs/configuration):\n\n- targetBrowsers: `String` (default: [`\"defaults\"`](https://browsersl.ist/#q=defaults))\n  first, the config will be looked up in the `package.json` `browserslist` property, second the config is searched in an external `.browserlistrc` file and if nothing has been found, the targeted browsers can be defined with the shared browser compatibility config from [browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) within this configuration option; to transpile back to ES5 you can i.e. use the browserslist configuration: `\">0.2% and not dead\"`\n\n- transformTypeScript: `boolean|Object` (old: `transpileTypeScript`)\n  includes the Babel presets [`@babel/preset-typescript`](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-typescript) and [`babel-preset-transform-ui5`](https://github.com/ui5-community/babel-plugin-transform-modules-ui5) into Babels preset configuration (if `transformModulesToUI5` is explicitely set to `false` the `babel-preset-transform-ui5` will not be added to the presets); if the value is type of `Object` the configuration option is considered to be `true` and the configuration object will be used for the `@babel/preset-typescript`\n\n- transformModulesToUI5: `boolean|Object`\n  includes the [`babel-preset-transform-ui5`](https://github.com/ui5-community/babel-plugin-transform-modules-ui5) into Babels preset configuration (included implicitly when `transpileTypeScript` is set to `true` and this configuration option is omitted); if the value is type of `Object` the configuration option is considered to be `true` and the configuration object will be used for the `babel-preset-transform-ui5`; this preset ensures that ES module `import`s will be transpiled to UI5 classic `sap.ui.define` or `sap.ui.require` calls and ES UI5 classes to classic UI5 classes using the `extend` API\n\n- transformAsyncToPromise: `boolean` (old: `transpileAsync`)\n  includes the [`babel-plugin-transform-async-to-promises`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-async-to-promises) into Babels presert configuration which transpiles `async/await` statements into `Promise`s; otherwise Babel uses `@babel/plugin-transform-regenerator` to transpile `async/await` with [`regenerator-runtime`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/regenerator-runtime) which isn't [CSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy) compliant\n\n- removeConsoleStatements: `boolean`  \n  includes the [babel-plugin-transform-remove-console](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-remove-console) which removes the console statement from the transpiled code\n\n> :warning: When using `builder` > `settings` > `includeDependency` to add references to other projects (libraries, modules, ...) which also require a Babel transformation, the Babel configuration lookup or the `tsconfig.json` lookup will take place relative to the current working directory. If you want to ensure to use project local configurations in this case, inline the Babel configuration `babelConfig` and the `transformTypeScript` (with `true`=TS or `false`=JS) switch explicitly in the `ui5.yaml`.\n\n## Usage\n\nBy default, the UI5 CLI extension is configuration free and works out-of-the-box. The programming language is derived from the existence of the `tsconfig.json` in the project root.\n\nDefine the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-tooling-transpile\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nRegister the task and middleware in your `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n  - name: ui5-tooling-transpile-task\n    afterTask: replaceVersion\n[...]\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-tooling-transpile-middleware\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n```\n\nThat's it. Now you can transpile your sources with the help of Babel.\n\n### Advanced Options\n\nConfiguration options are added in the configuration section. For JavaScript projects, ensure that no `tsconfig.json` is present in the project root. This would turn the UI5 CLI extension into the TypeScript mode.\n\nExample configuration for a JavaScript project without external Babel configuration which removes console statements and exclude specific paths:\n\n```yaml\nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n  - name: ui5-tooling-transpile-task\n    afterTask: replaceVersion\n    configuration:\n      debug: true\n      removeConsoleStatements: true\n      excludePatterns:\n      - \"lib/\"\n      - \"another/dir/in/webapp\"\n      - \"yet/another/dir\"\n[...]\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-tooling-transpile-middleware\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      debug: true\n      removeConsoleStatements: true\n      excludePatterns:\n      - \"lib/\"\n      - \"another/dir/in/webapp\"\n      - \"yet/another/dir\"\n```\n\nExample configuration for a TypeScript project without external Babel configuration which transforms `async/await` to `Promises` and removes console statements:\n\n```yaml\nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n  - name: ui5-tooling-transpile-task\n    afterTask: replaceVersion\n    configuration:\n      debug: true\n      transformAsyncToPromise: true\n      removeConsoleStatements: true\n[...]\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-tooling-transpile-middleware\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      debug: true\n      transformAsyncToPromise: true\n      removeConsoleStatements: true\n```\n\n## Support\n\nPlease use the GitHub bug tracking system to post questions, bug reports or to create pull requests.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAny type of contribution (code contributions, pull requests, issues) to this set of UI5 CLI extensions will be equally appreciated.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

UI5 custom control `ui5-cc-md`\n\nThis namespace contains a custom control rendering regular + github-flavored Markdown content, either provided as a string or from a file.  \nIt outputs plain HTML, ready to be included in an XML view.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\n$> yarn add ui5-cc-md\n# or\n$> npm install ui5-cc-md\n```\n\n## Included controls\n\n- `Markdown`: transforms Markdown to HTML\n  - properties: (note: either `content` or `fromFile` can be used, not both)\n    - `content: <String>`: Markdown as raw string\n    - `fromFile: <Path>`: relative path to a file containing Markdwon\n  - aggregations: -\n\n## Usage\n\n1. define the dependeny in `$yourapp/package.json`\n\n   ```json\n   // it is already in \"dependencies\" after installation\n   \"ui5\": {\n     \"dependencies\": [\n       // ...\n       \"ui5-cc-md\",\n       // ...\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. declare the namespace in your XML view and use the custom control from that namespace\n\n   ```xml\n   <mvc:View ... \n           xmlns:md=\"cc.md\"\n           ...>\n      <md:Markdown content=\"***markdown is nice!***&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;if only there wasn't the CR problem in XML view string\" />\n      <md:Markdown fromFile=\"./fragment.md\" />\n      <md:Markdown content=\"{/markdownContent}\" />\n   </mvc:View>\n   ```\n\n## How it works\n\n`Markdown` uses the [npm module `marked`](https://marked.js.org) for transforming content from Markdown to HTML.\n\n## Build time (in apps)\n\nUse `ui5 build --all` to produce a deployable version of your app including `ui5-cc-md` and its’ control(s).\n\nOther than that, nothing specific to note for using `ui5-cc-md` in builds in UI5 apps.\n\n## Tests\n\nThe `test` folder contains a minimal UI5 app requiring `ui5-cc-md`. \n\nFor testing manually, do:\n\n```bash\n$> yarn test:manual # runs ui5 serve\n# now point a browser to http://localhost:8080\n```\n\nThe [livereload middleware](https://github.com/petermuessig/ui5-ecosystem-showcase/tree/master/packages/ui5-middleware-livereload) is included, so changes to the test app get reloaded immediately.\n\nA full automated test suite is setup with [Jest + puppeteer](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/puppeteer), starting `ui5 serve` and running all `/test/**/*.test.js` :\n\n```bash\n$> cd test/ui5-app\n$> yarn # for installing runtime dependencies\n$> cd ..\n$> yarn test\n# sample output:\n PASS  test/ui5-app/basic.test.js\n  Markdown\n    ✓ should render markdown via content property (2374 ms)\n    ✓ should render markdown via fromFile property (854 ms)\n    ✓ should render markdown via binding (672 ms)\n\nTest Suites: 1 passed, 1 total\nTests:       3 passed, 3 total\nSnapshots:   0 total\nTime:        4.512 s, estimated 5 s\nRan all test suites.\n✨  Done in 11.90s.\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](./LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

Status][license-image]][license-url]\n[![useses node >= 16][node-img]][node-url]\n[![useses nvm][nvm-img]][nvm-url]\n\nA project generator for projects that contain one or more UI5 applications (\"uimodules\") and manage them via [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces). The uimodules itself use the official UI5 tooling. The generator contains multiple [subgenerators](#subgenerators) to help with recurring tasks. It also supports [multiple deployment targets](#deployment) on the SAP Business Technology Platform. This generator was build as a plug-in for the community project [easy-ui5](https://github.com/SAP/generator-easy-ui5/) by [SAP](https://github.com/SAP/).\n\nIf you are looking to create a simple UI5 project with no deployment configuration and don't plan to add multiple uimodules, check out the [generator-ui5-app](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-app).\n\n> As of version `0.1.0`, we strive to share core functionality (such as webapp scaffolding) with [SAP's `open-ux-tools`](https://github.com/SAP/open-ux-tools) effort, which is \"a set of tools and libraries that makes it faster and easier to develop SAP Fiori applications\".\n\n## Usage with easy-ui5\n\n```bash\nnpm i -g yo generator-easy-ui5\nyo easy-ui5 project\n\n     _-----_\n    |       |    ╭──────────────────────────╮\n    |--(o)--|    │  Welcome to the easy-ui5 │\n   `---------´   │        generator!        │\n    ( _´U`_ )    ╰──────────────────────────╯\n    /___A___\\   /\n     |  ~  |\n   __'.___.'__\n ´   `  |° ´ Y `\n```\n\n## Subgenerators\n\nThis generator is split up into multiple subgenerators to help with recurring tasks even after the initial project generation. See the following list for all available subgenerators:\n\n<details>\n<summary>uimodule</summary>\n\n<br>\n\n```bash\nyo easy-ui5 project uimodule\n```\nThis subgenerator adds a new uimodule to an existing project. It reuses the config of the existing project and uimodule(s).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>fpmpage</summary>\n\n<br>\n\n```bash\nyo easy-ui5 project fpmpage\n```\nThis subgenerator adds a new flexible programming model (fpm) page to one of the existing uimodules. This subgenerator only works for projects that enabled the flexible programming model during project creation.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>model</summary>\n\n<br>\n\n```bash\nyo easy-ui5 project model\n```\nThis subgenerator adds a new data model to one of the existing uimodules. Supported model types are `OData v4`, `OData v2`, and `JSON`. The subgenerator can optionally set-up a proxy to the respective data source via the `ui5.yaml`.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>view</summary>\n\n<br>\n\n```bash\nyo easy-ui5 project view\n```\nThis subgenerator adds a new XML view to one of the existing uimodules. Only XML views are supported. The subgenerator can optionally set-up the corresponding route and target in the `manifest.json`.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>customcontrol</summary>\n\n<br>\n\n```bash\nyo easy-ui5 project customcontrol\n```\nThis subgenerator adds a new custom control (which extends an existing UI5 control) to one of the existing uimodules.  \n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>qunit</summary>\n\n<br>\n\n```bash\nyo easy-ui5 project qunit\n```\nThis subgenerator adds a qunit test (unit test) to one of the existing uimodules.  \n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>opa5</summary>\n\n<br>\n\n```bash\nyo easy-ui5 project opa5\n```\nThis subgenerator adds a OPA5 journey (integration test) and page object to one of the existing uimodules.  \n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>cap</summary>\n\n<br>\n\n```bash\nyo easy-ui5 project cap\n```\nThis subgenerator adds an SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) server for the Node.js runtime to the project and connects one of the existing uimodules to it (via the [cds-plugin-ui5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cds-plugin-ui5) and a dev dependency). This subgenerator is basically a convenvience wrapper around the [cds init](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/in-a-nutshell#jumpstart) command - with the added benefit of constructing a deployment-ready `mta.yaml` file on root level of the project, that includes all necessary artifacts in line with the selected [deployment target](#deployment).\n\n</details>\n\n## Deployment\n\nProjects created with this generator use the [Multitarget Application](https://sap.github.io/cloud-mta-build-tool/) approach and can be built and deployed out of the box:\n\n> Make sure you have the [Cloud Foundry CLI installed](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-cf-download-cli.html) and are logged in to your Cloud Foundry environment via the `cf login` command.\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\nnpm run deploy\n```\n\nDuring the prompting phase, the generator will ask on which target platform you want to deploy your project. See the following list for all available deployment targets:\n\n<details>\n<summary>Static webserver</summary>\n\n<br>\n\nWith this option the project gets deployed to Cloud Foundry via the [Staticfile buildpack](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/staticfile/) to run on a static webserver without authentication or proxys in place.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Application Router</summary>\n\n<br>\n\nWith this option the project gets deployed to Cloud Foundry in the form of an Application Router, which is a Node.js application ([Node.js buildpack](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/node/index.html)) that acts as a reverse proxy and can handle authentication as well different routes within your project. The uimodules of your project are served via the local `dist/` directory of the Application Router.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Application Frontend Service</summary>\n\n<br>\n\nWith this option the project gets deployed to Cloud Foundry via the [Application Frontend Service](https://help.sap.com/docs/application-frontend-service/application-frontend-service/what-is-application-frontend-service) using the MTA-based approach (Multi-Target Application).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>SAP HTML5 Application Repository Service</summary>\n\n<br>\n\nWith this option the project gets deployed to Cloud Foundry via the SAP HTML5 Application Repository Service. This makes the application visible in the \"HTML5 Applications\" section in your SAP BTP subaccount and is the foundation for accessing with other apps and services on SAP BTP.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition</summary>\n\n<br>\n\nWith this option the project gets deployed to Cloud Foundry via the SAP HTML5 Application Repository Service and is also accessible via SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition, which provides a Fiori Launchpad for your applications. \n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>SAP NetWeaver</summary>\n\n<br>\n\nWith this option the uimodules gets deployed to SAP NetWeaver using the [deploy-to-abap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/ux-ui5-tooling#deployment-to-abap) task.\n\n> Note: You have to run `npm run deploy` for the uimodules individually (in their respective directories) to deploy them, which is different to the other deployment scenarios.\n\n</details>\n\n\n## Debugging\n\nFollow these steps to debug this generator (or run it in standalone mode for that matter):\n\n1. Clone this repository.\n1. Install the local repository globally via the following command: `npm link`\n1. Start one of the [subgenerators](#subgenerators) in a JavaScript Debug Terminal within VS Code: `yo ui5-project:<subgenerator>`\n\n> If you are feeling really fancy, you can also start a subgenerator via the native Node.js debugger and connect an editor of your choice (any Neovim users here? 👋🏻) via the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/): `node --inspect node_modules/yo/lib/cli.js ui5-project:<subgenerator>`\n\nHappy coding!\n\n## Support\n\nPlease use the GitHub bug tracking system to post questions, bug reports or to create pull requests.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome any type of contribution (code contributions, pull requests, issues) to this generator equally.

It automatically benefits from all the available [UI5 Community generators](https://github.com/ui5-community/?q=generator-ui5&type=all&language=&sort=).\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThis NPM packages just adds a few more options to use the Easy-UI5 Yeoman generator - but even a bit easier...\n\n### Option 1: Using `npm-init`\n\nThe [`npm-init`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-init) command is used to setup new repositories. You can use the `create-easy-ui5` package for `npm-init` like this:\n\n```sh\nnpm init easy-ui5 [template]\n```\n\nThe `create-easy-ui5` package doesn't need to be installed upfront to be used as `npm-init` is downloading it automatically from the central NPM registry.\n\n### Option 2: Using `npx`\n\nThe [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx) command is used to run NPM packages directly and can be used to run the setup script:\n\n```sh\nnpx create-easy-ui5 [template]\n```\n\nThe `create-easy-ui5` package doesn't need to be installed upfront to be used as `npm-init` is downloading it automatically from the central NPM registry.\n\n### Option 3: Using `easy-ui5` binary\n\nThe `easy-ui5` binary is provided by the `create-easy-ui5` NPM package and once installed it can be used to setup new repositories using the Easy-UI5 Yeoman generator:\n\n```sh\n# Install create-easy-ui5\nnpm i -g create-easy-ui5\n\n# Run the binary\neasy-ui5 [template]\n```\n\n## Support\n\nPlease use the GitHub bug tracking system to post questions, bug reports or to create pull requests.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome any type of contribution (code contributions, pull

Platform. This generator was built as a plug-in for the community project [Easy-UI5](https://github.com/SAP/generator-easy-ui5/) by [SAP](https://github.com/SAP/).\n\n## Usage with easy-ui5\n\n```bash\n$> npm i -g yo generator-easy-ui5\n$> yo easy-ui5 ts-app-fcl\n\n     _-----_\n    |       |    ╭──────────────────────────╮\n    |--(o)--|    │  Welcome to the easy-ui5 │\n   `---------´   │        generator!        │\n    ( _´U`_ )    ╰──────────────────────────╯\n    /___A___\\   /\n     |  ~  |\n   __'.___.'__\n ´   `  |° ´ Y `\n```\n\nAfter the generation of your project you can use `npm start` (or `yarn start`) to start the local development server.\n\n## Standalone usage\n\nNote the different greeting when the generator starts:\n\n```bash\n$> npm i -g yo\n$> yo ./generator-ui5-ts-app-fcl\n\n     _-----_     ╭──────────────────────────╮\n    |       |    │    Welcome to the        │\n    |--(o)--|    │ generator-ui5-ts-app-fcl │\n   `---------´   │      generator!          │\n    ( _´U`_ )    ╰──────────────────────────╯\n    /___A___\\   /\n     |  ~  |\n   __'.___.'__\n ´   `  |° ´ Y `\n```\n## Options\nBesides the options you have in the basic TypeScript template like appname and namespace, we have added more options that will be used to configure the OData service:\n### EndPoint\nThis should be an endpoint that points to the Service Document of your OData service, like for example the northwind service: https://services.odata.org/V2/OData/OData.svc/\n### EntitySet\nBased on the provided OData Service Document, the generator will provide you a list of all available OData EntitySets. You will be able to select one as your main EntitySet. The Master page will show a list of all entries in this EntitySet, while the detail page will show the details of the selected entry.\n### Key\nThe next option is the key. You'll have to select the field you would like to use as the main key. This will be used in the routing configuration as parameter to navigate to the detail page.\n### Title\nThe title option will be bound to the title in the list as well as on the detail page.\n### Other Field\nThis last one is an open and free field to bind a second field to the table and on the detail page. It can be a numbe or a description of the title. Just one additional field to kickstart your project!\n\n## Support\n\nPlease use the GitHub bug tracking system to post questions, bug reports or to create pull requests.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome any type of contribution (code contributions, pull requests, issues) to this generator equally.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the Apache Software License, version 2.0 except as noted otherwise in the LICENSE file.\n\n[license-image]: https://img.shields.io/github/license/ui5-community/generator-ui5-ts-app-fcl.svg\n[license-url]: https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-ts-app-fcl/blob/main/LICENSE\n\n---------------------------\n###### This generator is provided to you by Peter Muessig and Wouter Lemaire","downloadsCurrentMonth":-1,"downloadsCurrentFortnight":-1,"downloads365":-1},{"name":"generator-ui5-flp-plugin","version":"0.0.1","description":"(Sub-)generator for a UI5 Fiori Launchpad Plugin","main":"generators/app/index.js","type":"generator","scripts":{"lint":"eslint .","lint:fix":"eslint . --fix","lint:staged":"lint-staged","format":"prettier --write .","format:staged":"pretty-quick --staged --verbose","test":"cd test && yo ../generators/app/index.js","prepare":"husky || true","hooks:pre-commit":"npm run format:staged && npm run lint:staged"},"keywords":["yeoman-generator","sap","sapui5","openui5","ui5","project-template","flp-plugin","fiori-launchpad-plugin"],"author":"SAP (Amar Ubhe)","license":"apache-2.0","repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-flp-plugin.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-flp-plugin/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-flp-plugin#readme","files":["helpers","generators"],"dependencies":{"chalk":"^5.3.0","glob":"^11.0.0","package-json":"^10.0.1","semver":"^7.6.3","upath":"^2.0.1","yeoman-generator":"^5.9.0","yosay":"^2.0.2"},"devDependencies":{"@prettier/plugin-xml":"^3.4.1","eslint":"^9.9.1","eslint-plugin-jsdoc":"^50.2.2","globals":"^15.9.0","husky":"^9.1.5","lint-staged":"^15.2.10","prettier":"^3.3.3","prettier-plugin-properties":"^0.3.0","pretty-quick":"^4.0.0","yeoman-assert":"^3.1.1","yeoman-test":"^8.3.0"},"overrides":{"minimist":">=1.2.6"},"tags":["flp"],"gitHubOwner":"ui5-community","gitHubRepo":"generator-ui5-flp-plugin","licenseSource":"apache-2.0","forks":3,"stars":8,"addedToBoUI5":"2022-04-14T00:00:00.007Z","createdAt":"2021-07-05T15:02:32Z","updatedAt":"2025-09-02T11:54:25Z","vscodeInstalls":-1,"sourceType":"generator","githublink":"https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-flp-plugin/tree/master/","readme":"# Generator for SAPUI5 Fiori Launchpad Plugin\n\n> Generator for UI5 Fiori Launchpad Plugin using UI5 Tooling.

[![test](https://github.com/mauriciolauffer/openui5-error-collector/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mauriciolauffer/openui5-error-collector/actions/workflows/test.yml)\n\nThis library collects javascript errors and can send them to a backend, if errors need to be logged and saved for further analysis:\n\n* vanilla [js errors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/error_event) (reference, syntax, type, etc)\n* Promises with [unhandled rejections](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/unhandledrejection_event)\n* UI5 log events from [sap/base/Log](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/index.html#/api/module:sap/base/Log)\n* errors from [Report API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Reporting_API)\n\n## Demo\n\nYou can check out a live demo here:\n\n<https://mauriciolauffer.github.io/openui5-error-collector/demo/index.html>\n\n## Project Structure\n\n* demo - Library's live demo\n* dist - Distribution folder which contains the library ready to use\n* src  - Development folder\n* test - Testing framework for the library\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall openui5-error-collector as an npm module\n\n```sh\n$ npm install openui5-error-collector\n```\n\n### How to use\n\nImport openui5-error-collector to your UI5 application as a regular javascript file. You should import it before `sap-ui-bootstrap` to  capture UI5 bootstrap errors as well.\n\n```html\n<script async src=\"dist/ui5ErrorCollector.min.js\"></script>\n<script async id=\"sap-ui-bootstrap\" src=\"/resources/sap-ui-core.js\" ... ></script>\n```\n\nOnce imported, all errors will be automatically captured. It also exposes a global variable `ui5ErrorCollector`, eg, `window.ui5ErrorCollector` which can be used to get the errors and to set the details to send them to a backend server.\n\n#### Sending errors to a backend\n\nDevelopers can send all errors to a backend server setting `serverUrl` with method `ui5ErrorCollector.setConfiguration`. Once `serverUrl` is set, errors'll be sent to it using `navigator.sendBeacon` (this is not supported by IE11).\n\n```js\nui5ErrorCollector.setConfiguration({\n  serverUrl: 'https://my-backend-server.com'\n});\n```\n\nTo make it compatible with IE11, or to add any extra logic when synchronizing (transform the payload, send to multiple backends, etc), a callback `onSyncHook` can be passed to method `ui5ErrorCollector.setConfiguration`. This'll replace the default behaviour and use the provided callback `onSyncHook` rather than `navigator.sendBeacon`.\n\n```js\n/**\n * Callback provided to replace default sync with backend server\n *\n * @param {string} serverUrl - Server URL\n * @param {UI5ErrorLogEvent[]} errors - List of captured errors, same as ui5ErrorCollector.getErrors() results\n */\nfunction myCustomOnSyncHook(serverUrl, errors) {\n  // Go crazy, do whatever you wanna here...\n  const payload = JSON.stringify(errors);\n  fetch(serverUrl, {body: payload, method: 'POST'});\n  $.ajax(serverUrl, {body: payload, method: 'POST'});\n}\n\nui5ErrorCollector.setConfiguration({\n  serverUrl: 'https://my-backend-server.com',\n  onSyncHook: myCustomOnSyncHook\n});\n```\n\n#### Retrieving errors\n\nMehod `ui5ErrorCollector.getErrors` will return all captured errors.\n\n```js\nui5ErrorCollector.getErrors(); // Which returns an array of the following object:\n\n/**\n* @type {object}\n* @property {string} type - Log event type\n* @property {string} timestamp - When event was logged\n* @property {string} uri - Where event was logged\n* @property {?string} stack - Error stack\n* @property {string} message - Error message\n* @property {?string} component - UI5 Log component\n* @property {number} level - Log level\n* @property {?number} elapsedTimestamp - Elapsed time since page load\n* @property {?string} filename - File which triggered the error\n*/\n\n// Some data sample:\n[\n  {\n      \"type\": \"error\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"2022-02-14T05:59:02.987Z\",\n      \"uri\": \"http://localhost:3000/test/webapp/index.html\",\n      \"stack\": \"TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'substring')\\n    at http://localhost:3000/test/webapp/index.html:30:40\",\n      \"message\": \"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'substring')\",\n      \"component\": null,\n      \"level\": 1,\n      \"elapsedTimestamp\": 755.1999999880791,\n      \"filename\": \"http://localhost:3000/test/webapp/index.html\"\n  },\n  {\n      \"type\": \"deprecation\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"2022-02-14T05:59:03.294Z\",\n      \"uri\": \"http://localhost:3000/test/webapp/index.html\",\n      \"stack\": null,\n      \"message\": \"Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience.

extended and smarter version of UI5 MockServer for meaningful mock data.\n\nOpenUI5 Smart MockServer uses the open source library Faker.js to generate better fake data for testing your app or for a demo.\nYou can use any available method in [Faker.js](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/#api-methods).\n\nSmart data can be automatically generated based on OData SAP Semantics Annotations. You don't need to code anything, just run Smart MockServer with a metadata.xml containing SAP Semantics Annotations.\nIn case your metadata.xml doesn't have SAP Semantics annotations, you can set Smart Rules manually mapping the OData property to a Faker.js method.\n\n*Regular MockServer:* just a bunch of texts and numbers\n![Regular MockServer](./mockserver.png)\n\n*Smart MockServer:* meaningful data, better for tests and presentations to customer\n![Smart MockServer\">](./smartmockserver.png)\n\n## OData SAP Semantics Annotations\n\nOData SAP Semantic Annotations tell which of the OData properties contain e.g. a phone number, a part of a name or address, or something related to a calendar event or an analytic query. This is important for apps running on mobile devices that want to seamlessly integrate into contacts, calendar, and telephony.\n<https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/EmTech/SAP+Annotations+for+OData+Version+2.0#SAPAnnotationsforODataVersion2.0-Property_sap_semanticsAttributesap:semantics>\n\nSmart MockServer will generate data for these properties automatically, but not for all of them, have a look at the demo to see the supported *sap:semantics* annotations.\n\n## Faker.js\n\nFor any references, please follow\n\nFaker.js: <https://github.com/marak/Faker.js>\n\nFaker.js methods: <https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/#api-methods>\n\n## Demo\n\nYou can check out a live demo here:\n\n<https://mauriciolauffer.github.io/openui5-smart-mockserver/demo/webapp/index.html>\n\nAnd for a live demo using ServiceWorker:\n\n<https://mauriciolauffer.github.io/openui5-smart-mockserver/demo-sw/webapp/index.html>\n\n## Project Structure\n\n* demo - Library's live demo\n* demo-sw - Library's live demo with ServiceWorker\n* dist - Distribution folder which contains the library ready to use\n* src  - Development folder\n* test - Testing framework for the library\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall openui5-smart-mockserver as an npm module\n\n```sh\n$ npm install openui5-smart-mockserver\n```\n\n### Configure manifest.json\n\nAdd the library to *sap.ui5/dependencies/libs* and set its path in *sap.ui5/resourceRoots* in your manifest.json file, as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sap.ui5\": {\n    \"dependencies\": {\n      \"libs\": {\n        \"openui5.smartmockserver\": {}\n      }\n    },\n    \"resourceRoots\": {\n      \"openui5.smartmockserver\": \"./FOLDER_WHERE_YOU_PLACED_THE_LIBRARY/openui5/smartmockserver/\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### How to use\n\nYou can use Smart MockServer just like you use your old MockServer!\nImport openui5-smart-mockserver to your UI5 controller using *sap.ui.define* or *sap.ui.require*:\n\n```javascript\nsap.ui.define([\n    'openui5/smartmockserver/SmartMockServer'\n  ], function (SmartMockServer) {\n    'use strict';\n\n    return {\n      init: function() {\n        const metadataUrl = 'local/path/to/the/file/metadata.xml';\n        const mockServerUrl = 'odata/service/url';\n        const mockServer = new SmartMockServer({ rootUri: mockServerUrl });\n\n        // You only need to call this method in case your metadata.xml doesn't have sap:semantics annotations\n        // and you want to create nice data for the OData property\n        mockServer.setSmartRules(this._getSmartRules());\n\n        SmartMockServer.config({\n          autoRespond: true,\n          autoRespondAfter: 1\n        });\n\n        mockServer.simulate(metadataUrl, {\n          bGenerateMissingMockData: true\n        });\n\n        mockServer.start();\n      },\n\n      _getSmartRules: function() {\n      //Here we define the smart rules for entity's properties\n        const smartRules = []; //Smart rules must be an array with objects such as the following example\n        smartRules.push({\n          entityName: 'Employee', //Entity Name\n          properties: [\n            {\n              name: 'FirstName', // Entity's property name\n              fakerMethod: 'name.firstName' //Faker.js method which will be used for this property\n            },\n            { name: 'Address', fakerMethod: 'location.streetAddress' },\n            { name: 'Phone', fakerMethod: 'phone.number' },\n            { name:

Introduction\n\nThis is a custom module integrated with ui5-tooling to deploy Fiori/UI5 apps to SAP environments. This module is under development and it is not part of the official SAP ui5-tooling. For now, it uses a custom version of ui5-cli for deployment capabilities. It's heavily inspired on ui5-build.\n\nFeel free to contribute to the project. PRs are welcome  =)\n\n## Deploy to\n\nYou should be able to deploy to:\n\n- SAP Netweaver: ABAP server (via OData or ADT)\n- SAP Cloud Platform: NEO environment\n- SAP Cloud Platform: Cloud Foundry environment\n\n## Project Configuration\n\nTypically located in a ui5.yaml file per project. You have 3 options for remote systems. They share some configuration, but each one has its own specific details.\n\nThis is the basic setup for ui5-deployer shared across all remote system options, it does not include the specific details for a given remote system. Some of the properties are not required, some are.\n\n### Properties\n\n#### *\\<root>*\n\nThe ui5.yaml file from your Fiori/UI5 application/library should have a new section called **deployer**. Deployer section has the following parameters:\n\n#### ui5.yaml file for *deployer*\n\n`deployer`: root attribute, all deployer details go under it\n- `type`: Indicates the remote system where the project will be deployed. Must be `sap-netweaver` || `sap-cp-neo` || `sap-cp-cf`\n- `sourcePath`: Path to the folder where your production ready project is\n- `connection`: Connection details to the remote system\n  - `url`: URL endpoint to connect to the remote system\n  - `proxy` (optional): an HTTP proxy to be used\n  - `strictSSL` (optional): if true, requires SSL certificates to be valid. Note: to use your own certificate authority, you need to specify the path to the SSL Certificate. Must be `true` || `false`. Default is `false`.\n  - `SSLCertificatePath` (optional): path to the SSL Certificate in case you are using your own certificate authority\n- `credentials`: Credentials to be used when accessing the remote system. This section will be removed soon as it might be a huge security issue. One might end up pushing username/password to the git repo. Username/password should be passed via CLI command only.\n  - `username`: Username\n  - `password`: Password\n- `sapCloudPlatform` (optional): SAP Cloud Platform target\n  - `neo` (optional): NEO environment target\n    - `account`: SAP CP NEO Account\n    - `cliPath` (optional):  In case neo CLI is not global, inform the path to it. <https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/7613dee4711e1014839a8273b0e91070.html>\n  - `cloudFoundry` (optional): CF environment target\n    - `org`: Organization\n    - `space`: Space\n    - `cliPath` (optional): In case cf CLI is not global, inform the path to it. <https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli>\n- `abapRepository` (optional): SAP NetWeaver ABAP Repository target\n  - `client`: SAP client/mandt\n  - `language`: SAP Logon Language\n  - `transportRequest`: ABAP Transport Request Number\n  - `package`: ABAP Package\n  - `bspApplication`: BSP Application name\n  - `bspApplicationText`: BSP Application description\n  - `method`: `adt` || `odata`. Default is `adt`. ADT API endpoint is `/sap/bc/adt`. OData API endpoint is `/sap/opu/odata/UI5/ABAP_REPOSITORY_SRV`. ADT is the default to avoid breaking old projects. However, OData is recommended for better performance, it doesn't send multiples files, it sends just a single ***.zip** containing the whole project.\n  - `skipAdtValidations` (optional): Does not validate the existence of some ADT APIs, ABAP packages and Transport Requests used during deployment. Used for older ABAP versions where these ADT APIs are not available. Must be `true` || `false`. Default is `false`.\n  - `appIndexCalculate` (optional): Calculation of SAPUI5 Application Index for SAPUI5 Repositories (/UI5/APP_INDEX_CALCULATE). See [SAPUI5 Application Index](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/c5e7098474274d3eb7379047ab792f1f). Must be `true` || `false`. Default is `false`.\n\n## SAP Netweaver: ABAP server\n\n```yml\nspecVersion: '1.0'\nmetadata:\n  name: ui5-deployer-app-test\ntype: application\ncustomConfiguration:\n  deployer:\n    type: sap-netweaver\n    sourcePath: dist/ # Path to the project to be deployed\n    resources:\n      excludes:\n        - \"dist/path_to_excluded/**\"\n    connection:\n      url: https://dev.my-sap-server.com\n      proxy: https://my.proxy.com:43000\n      strictSSL: true\n      SSLCertificatePath: /certs/my-ssl-certificate.pem\n    credentials:\n      username: MyUsername\n      password: MyPassword\n    abapRepository:\n      client: 100\n      language: EN\n      transportRequest: ABAPDK999999\n      package: ZMYPACKAGE\n      bspApplication: ZDEPLOYAPP001\n      bspApplicationText: TEST DEPLOY APP x1\n      method: odata\n      skipAdtValidations: true\n      appIndexCalculate: true\n```\n\n## SAP Cloud Platform: NEO environment\n\n```yml\nspecVersion: '1.0'\nmetadata:\n  name: ui5-deployer-app-test\ntype: application\ncustomConfiguration:\n  deployer:\n    type: sap-cp-neo\n    sourcePath: /dist/*.mtar # Path to the .mtar file to be deployed\n    connection:\n      url: https://hanatrial.ondemand.com\n    credentials:\n      username: MyUsername\n      password: MyPassword\n    sapCloudPlatform:\n      neo:\n        account: myNEO12345Account\n        cliPath: C:\\neo-java-web-sdk\\tools\n```\n\n## SAP Cloud Platform: Cloud Foundry environment\n\n```yml\nspecVersion: '1.0'\nmetadata:\n  name: ui5-deployer-app-test\ntype: application\ncustomConfiguration:\n  deployer:\n    type: sap-cp-cf\n    sourcePath: /dist # Path to the manifest.yml file: https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html\n    connection:\n      url: https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com\n    credentials:\n      username: MyUsername\n      password: MyPassword\n    sapCloudPlatform:\n      cloudFoundry:\n        org: myORG\n        space: mySPACE\n        cliPath: C:\\cf-cli\\tools\n```\n\n### For projects using ui5.yaml specVersion 2.1 or higher\n\nProjects using ui5.yaml specVersion 2.1 or higher must use the new `customConfiguration` property.\nhttps://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/Configuration/#custom-configuration\n\nPS: you can also use the `customConfiguration` setup for any other specVersion, but 2.0\n\n```yml\nspecVersion: '2.1'\nmetadata:\n  name: ui5-deployer-app-test\ntype: application\ncustomConfiguration:\n  deployer:\n    type: sap-netweaver\n    sourcePath: dist/ # Path to the project to be deployed\n    connection:\n      url: https://dev.my-sap-server.com\n      strictSSL: false\n    credentials:\n      username: MyUsername\n      password: MyPassword\n    abapRepository:\n      client: 100\n      language: EN\n      transportRequest: ABAPDK999999\n      package: ZMYPACKAGE\n      bspApplication: ZDEPLOYAPP001\n      bspApplicationText: TEST DEPLOY APP x1\n```\n\n## Installing\n\nInstall ui5-deployer as a devDependency in your project.json\n\n```shell script\n$ npm i --save-dev ui5-deployer\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\nPick one of the remote systems above and edit your ui5.yaml file according to it.\n\nYou have the option to use all parameters as is from the ui5.yaml file or overwrite few of them when executing ui5-cli.\n\nYou can overwrite: `abapRepository.transportRequest` || `credentials.username` || `credentials.password` || `sapCloudPlatform.cloudFoundry.space`\n\n```shell script\n$ ui5-deployer deploy\n```\n\n```shell script\n$ ui5-deployer deploy --transport-request=ABAPDK99999\n```\n\n```shell script\n$ ui5-deployer deploy --username=MyUsername --password=MyPassword\n```\n\n```shell script\n$ ui5-deployer deploy --space=dev\n```\n\nYou can see an example here:\n<https://github.com/mauriciolauffer/ui5-deployer-app-test>\n\nThe modified ui5-cli can be found here: <https://github.com/mauriciolauffer/ui5-deployer-cli>\n\n### Support to Environment Variables\n\nThe aforementioned properties can also be set via Environment Variables. This option follows the [Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/config) best practices. The tool also supports `.env` files.\n\nThe expected Environment Variables are:\n\n```dosini\nUI5_DEPLOYER_USERNAME=MY_SAP_USER\nUI5_DEPLOYER_PASSWORD=MY_SAP_PASSWORD\nUI5_DEPLOYER_ABAP_TR=ABAPDK999999\nUI5_DEPLOYER_NEO_CLIPATH=/path/to/neo/cli/\nUI5_DEPLOYER_CF_SPACE=dev\n```\n\nIf you are using `.env` files, do not push them to your git repo as you may expose the secrets to everbody! Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.\n\n## Build and Test\n\nTODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the

This extension is not intended to replace ui5 cli, its main objective is to provide a fast and global workspace configuration to work with multi root workspaces and projects deployed to on premise systems (Gateway).\n\n## Examples\n\n> You can find examples of vscode workspace configuration in [this repository](https://github.com/CarlosOrozco88/ui5-tools-examples).\n\n## Features\n\n---\n\n### ui5-tools\n\n- **Automatic less builder**. Looks for `styles.less` and `PROJECTFOLDER.less`\n- **Automatic themes builder**. Build `library.source.less` themes\n- **Configurator** commands for odata proxy, resources proxy and replace strings\n\n#### Server\n\n- **Handles AppCachebuster** in localhost (by default only in PROD mode). Only use this feature to test your cachebuster behaviour with no deployment needed.\n- Configurable **proxy** to one o multiple **odata service** (Gateway, Other, None). Command `alt+c alt+o`\n- Supports `.env` file for odata service authentication. Example of `.env` file:\n\n```json\nUI5TOOLS_ODATA_USER=\nUI5TOOLS_ODATA_PASSWORD=\nUI5TOOLS_ODATA_USER_2=\nUI5TOOLS_ODATA_PASSWORD_2=\nUI5TOOLS_ODATA_USER_N=\nUI5TOOLS_ODATA_PASSWORD_N=\n```\n\n- Configurable **proxy** to **resources** (Gateway, CDN SAPUI5, CDN OpenUI5, Local Runtime, None). Command `alt+c alt+u`\n- Configurable UI5 version (when using gateway proxy, extension will detect sapui5 version automatically)\n- **Live reload browser**, css and images hot reload\n- **Typescript** support (ESM)\n- **Built in localhost home** page server, with apps launchpad, readme.md, docs (md files), links, server info...\n- **Built in launchpad** for resources: Gateway, CDN SAPUI5 and Runtime. Configurable with file `fioriSandboxConfig.json`\n- Server uses **folder hierarchy**. For product apps and Z apps, is possible to emulate gateway bsp paths\n- Start server in **development mode** `alt+s alt+s` or **production mode** `alt+s alt+p` (launches `appFolder/libraryFolder` or `distFolder` folder of each project)\n- Multiple comands: start `alt+s alt+s`, restart `alt+s alt+r`... (check commands secction)\n\n#### Builder\n\n- **Component-preload.js**, checking configured ui5 version for correct build. Build your project by doing right click in project folder or `alt+b alt+b` and select project\n- **Dbg** files creation\n- **Typescript** support (ESM)\n- **Build less** files (looks for `styles.css`, `PROJECTFOLDERNAME.less` or library.source.less)\n- **Uglify** files\n- **Replace strings**\n- Build one project `alt+b alt+b` or all apps `alt+b alt+a` in one command\n- Building preload (Component-preload and library-preload) process uses [openui5-preload](https://github.com/r-murphy/openui5-preload)\n- Building theme (library.source.less) process uses [less-openui5](https://github.com/SAP/less-openui5)\n- Building styles (styles.less and PROJECTFOLDER.less) process uses [less](https://github.com/less/less.js)\n\n#### Deployer\n\n- **Gateway deploy**, process includes build process. Deploy your project doing right click in project folder or `alt+d alt+d` and select project\n- **ui5-tools.json** file located at project folder, with deployment configuration: [ui5-tools.json example](https://github.com/CarlosOrozco88/ui5-tools-examples/blob/main/single-project/ui5-tools.json)\n- **Create, update and save** last order in ui5-tools.json file (configurable)\n- **Autoprefix** BSP name in order text while creation (optional)\n- Supports `.env` file for gateway authentication.\n\n```json\nUI5TOOLS_DEPLOY_USER=\nUI5TOOLS_DEPLOY_PASSWORD=\n```\n\n- Deploy process uses [ui5-nwabap-deployer-core\n  ](https://github.com/pfefferf/ui5-nwabap-deployer/blob/master/packages/ui5-nwabap-deployer-core), so the extension uses the same configuration in file ui5-tools.json (property deployer.options)\n\n#### Importer\n\n- **Import BSP** directly from Gateway systems `alt+i alt+i`\n- Supports `.env` file for gateway authentication.\n\n```json\nUI5TOOLS_IMPORT_USER=\nUI5TOOLS_IMPORT_PASSWORD=\n```\n\n### String replacer\n\n- **Default replace patterns** `<% TIMESTAMP %>`, `<% ISODATE %>`, `<% DMY %>`, `<% YMD %>`, `<% MYD %>`\n- **Create custom replacements** like `<% CUSTOMKEY %>` in workspace environment (configurable with command `alt+c alt+r`)\n- **Computed values** `COMPUTED_DATE_TIMESTAMP`, `COMPUTED_DATE_ISO`, `COMPUTED_DATE_DMY`, `COMPUTED_DATE_YMD`, `COMPUTED_DATE_MYD` and the special value `COMPUTED_DATE_FORMATTED`\n- **Suports custom computed date format**, replacements using dayjs during the build process:\n\n```json\n\"ui5-tools.builder.replaceKeysValues\": [\n  {\n    \"key\": \"DATE_FORMATED_EXAMPLE\",\n    \"value\": \"COMPUTED_DATE_FORMAT\",\n    \"param\": \"DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm:SS\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## Settings\n\n---\n\n#### General Settings\n\n- `ui5-tools.appFolder`: Transpiled folder for applications (js) | default: `webapp`\n- `ui5-tools.libraryFolder`: Transpiled folder for libraries (js) | default: `src`\n- `ui5-tools.distFolder`: Destination folder in your project (final build) | default: `dist`\n- `ui5-tools.ui5Version`: UI5 library version for CDN proxy in server and build correct preload files: `1.71.63`\n- `ui5-tools.verbose`: Log al messages `false`\n\n#### Server Settings\n\n- `ui5-tools.server.name`: Server name | default: `UI5 Server`\n- `ui5-tools.server.port`: Set custom port of UI5 Server | default: `3000`\n- `ui5-tools.server.startOnLaunch`: Start server at launch vscode | default: `false`\n- `ui5-tools.server.openBrowser`: Open browser al launch server | default: `true`\n- `ui5-tools.server.watch`: Activate live reload | default: `true`\n- `ui5-tools.server.timeout`: Server timeout (ms), 0 for disable timeout | default: `60000`\n- `ui5-tools.server.watchExtensions`: Extensions to listen for live reload | default: `css,js,json,xml,html,properties`\n- `ui5-tools.server.protocol`: Should use http or https.

As an alternative to proxying OData requests to a live backend, it supports loading mock data for OData v2/v4 requests for supported Fiori elements templates. As the mock server runs locally without requiring a network connection to a backend system, it is useful for development and test scenarios.\n\n## Installation\nnpm\n`npm install --save-dev @sap-ux/ui5-middleware-fe-mockserver`\n\nyarn\n`yarn add @sap-ux/ui5-middleware-fe-mockserver --dev`\n\npnpm\n`pnpm add @sap-ux/ui5-middleware-fe-mockserver --dev`\n\n## Usage\n\nIn order to use the mock server, the npm module `@sap-ux/ui5-middleware-fe-mockserver` needs to be added as devDependency to `package.json`, and a valid `ui5.yaml` configuration needs to be provided.\n**Entries in package.json**\n\n```\n[..]\n\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@sap-ux/ui5-middleware-fe-mockserver\": \"^2\"\n}\n\n[..]\n```\n\n**Example for a yaml configuration file**\n\n```\n\nspecVersion: '3.0'\nmetadata:\n  name: <NAME>\ntype: application\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: sap-fe-mockserver\n      mountPath: /\n      afterMiddleware: compression\n      configuration:\n        annotations:\n          - localPath: './webapp/localService/myServiceAnnotation.xml'\n            urlPath: '/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/Annotations*'\n        services:\n          - urlPath: '/sap/opu/odata/sap/<SERVICE_NAME>'\n            metadataPath: './webapp/localService/metadata.xml'\n            mockdataPath: './webapp/localService/data'\n          - urlPath: '/sap/opu/odata/sap/<OTHER_SERVICE_NAME>'\n            metadataPath: './webapp/localService/other_metadata.xml'\n            mockdataPath: './webapp/localService/data'\n\n```\n\n### Special case within karma\n\nIf you are running the mockserver embedded in karma you need to change the configuration to use\n\n`beforeMiddleware: csp` instead of `afterMiddleware: compression`\n\n\n## Service Configuration\n\nEach service must provide at least two things\n\n- urlPath : where will your service be accessible from\n- metadataPath : local path to your metadata file\n\nOn top of that you can specify one of the following option\n\n- mockdataPath : the path to the folder containing the mockdata files\n- generateMockData : whether or not you want to use automatically generated mockdata\n- resolveExternalServiceReferences : whether or not to try to resolve all services referenced in `Common.ValueListReferences` annotations or CodeList annotations and serve their metadata from `localServices` directory.\n- forceNullableValuesToNull : determine if nullable properties should be generated as null or with a default value (defaults to false)\n\nAdditional option are available either per service of for all services if defined globally\n\n- debug : toggle the debug mode\n- logger: specify the logger to use, by default it will use the @ui5/logger\n- watch : toggle the watch mode, the mockserver will restart the service where data or metadata have changed\n- noETag : disable ETag support on metadata\n- strictKeyMode : disable the default \"loose\" mode for the key matching.\nBy default the mockserver will try many ways to match an entityset with its navigation property, which can result in some rather loose join of data. In case you have a very well defined mockdata and you feel the mockserver is returning too much data, you can enable this feature.\n\n- contextBasedIsolation : enable the support of \"tenants\" at the URL level.\nTenants allow you to work on the same app with dedicated, isolated tenant data.\nTenants are always available by using ?sap-client in your application url, however by enabling this setting you can also enable a specific path based tenant by prepending /tenant-xxx at the very start of your service call.\nOn top of the standard json file loading, when using tenants we will automatically try to fetch a specific json data from a file including the tenant ID in the name. \nFor instance if you have an entity called `Product` you can have a `Product.json` file containing the standard data and a `Product-testErrorXXX.json` file for a specific tenant called testErrorXXX.\nIf you don't have a tenant specific file, the mockserver will fallback to the standard file.\n\nYou can also define static annotation file using the `annotations` entry, each annotation must provide\n\n- urlPath : where will your annotation be accessible from\n- localPath : local path to your annotation file\n\n\n## Typescript support\n\nIf your application embed ts-node, the mockserver will use that automatically to load the mockdata files.\nYou can also specify a custom tsconfig file to use by adding the `tsConfigPath` entry globally.\n\n```\n        configuration:\n          tsConfigPath: './tsconfig-mockserver.json'\n          services:\n            - urlPath: '/sap/opu/odata/sap/<SERVICE_NAME>'\n              metadataPath: './webapp/localService/metadata.xml'\n              mockdataPath: './webapp/localService/data'\n```\nThis is useful if you want to have a different configuration for the mockserver than the one used for your application.\n\n**Documentation**\n\nYou can find more details on how to influence the mockserver behavior for mockdata by checking the documentation under [Defining Mockdata](https://github.com/SAP/open-ux-odata/blob/main/docs/DefiningMockdata.md)\n\nWe also have samples available in the [samples folder](https://github.com/SAP/open-ux-odata/tree/main/samples)\n\n\n**Sample application**\n\nSee the usage in demo apps [SAP Fiori sample apps](https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-tools-samples)\n\n\n## Support\n\nJoin the [SAP Fiori tools Community](https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Fiori+tools/pd-p/73555000100800002345).

The middleware is agnostic to running in local environments and SAP Business Application Studio. Additionally, if credentials are maintained with the SAP Fiori tools then these will be used.\n\nIt can be used either with the `ui5 serve` or the `fiori run` commands.\n\n## Configuration Options\n\n### `backend`\n| Option        | Type | Description |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ----------- |\n| `url`         | `string` mandatory (local)  | URL pointing to the backend system is mandatory, unless a destination is provided and the proxy is running on SAP Business Application Studio. Developers can append additional URL parameters if necessary |\n| `destination` | `string` mandatory (if no url) | Required if the backend system is available as destination in SAP Business Application Studio. |\n| `destinationInstance` | `string` optional | If a destination needs to be read by a specific instance of a destination service then you need to provide the id of the service as optional property `destinationInstance`.|\n| `path`        | `string` mandatory     | Path that is to be proxied |\n| `pathReplace`  | `string` optional      | If provided then the path will be replaced with this value before forwarding |\n| `client`      | `string` optional      | sap-client parameter |\n| `scp`         | `boolean` optional      | If set to true the proxy will execute the required OAuth routine for the ABAP environment on SAP BTP |\n| `apiHub`      | `boolean` optional      | If set to true then the proxy will connect to the SAP API Business Hub |\n| `proxy`       | `string` optional      | If set then it will override the proxy settings from node. |\n| `authenticationType` | `string` optional  | Authentication mechanism to be used in VSCode. Currently supported: \"ReentranceTicket\" |\n\nAdditional optional experimental property `bsp` (type `string`): The BSP property is only needed for the FLP Embedded Flow. The property refers to the BSP Application Name. In that case, we need to redirect the manifest.appdescr request to the local manifest.json in order to overwrite the deployed application with the local one.\n\n### `options`\nOptional object that can be used to directly set options of the used `http-proxy-middleware` modules (https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-proxy-middleware#http-proxy-middleware-options). Note: only declarative options (i.e. no functions) are supported.\n\n## Configuration Examples\n\n### [Connecting to a backend system](#connecting-to-a-backend-system)\n\nExecuting `ui5 serve` in your project with the configuration below in the `ui5.yaml` file would forward any request starting with the `path` parameter to the provided backend `url`.\n\n```yaml\n- name: backend-proxy-middleware\n  afterMiddleware: compression\n  configuration:\n    backend:\n      path: /sap\n      url: https://my.backend.example:1234\n```\n\n### [Connecting to a backend system with destination](#connecting-to-a-backend-system-with-destination)\n\nIf working in SAP Business Application Studio and the backend is configured as destination then you can also provide the `destination` in the configuration. \nIf a destination needs to be read by a specific instance of a destination service then you need to provide the id of the service as optional property `destinationInstance`.\n\n```yaml\n- name: backend-proxy-middleware\n  afterMiddleware: compression\n  configuration:\n    backend:\n      path: /sap\n      destination: my_example_destination\n```\n\n### [Connecting to a backend system with destination and principal propagation](#connecting-to-a-backend-system-with-destination-and-principal-propagation)\n\nIf the backend destination is configured to use principal propagation, then in some cases the requests might fail. If this occurs then you will need to set the optional property `xfwd` to `true`. This will add the x-forwared headers to the proxy requests.\n\n```yaml\n- name: backend-proxy-middleware\n  afterMiddleware: compression\n  configuration:\n    backend:\n      path: /sap\n      destination: my_example_destination\n    options:\n      xfwd: true\n```\n\n### [Connecting to the SAP Business Technology Platform](#connecting-to-the-sap-business-technology-platform)\nIf you want to connect to an ABAP Environment on SAP Business Technology Platform then you will need to set the optional property `scp` to `true`. For any other target, remove this property or set it to `false`.\n\n```yaml\n- name: backend-proxy-middleware\n  afterMiddleware: compression\n  configuration:\n    backend:\n      path: /sap\n      url: https://my.steampunk.example:1234\n      scp: true\n```\n\n### [Connecting to the SAP API Business Hub](#connecting-to-the-sap-api-business-hub)\nIf you want to connect to the SAP API Business Hub then you will need to set the optional property `apiHub` to `true`, and set the corresponding `path` and `url`, e.g.\n\n```yaml\n- name: backend-proxy-middleware\n  afterMiddleware: compression\n  configuration:\n    backend:\n      path: /s4hanacloud\n      url: https://api.sap.com\n      apiHub: true\n```\n\n### [Proxying WebSockets](#proxying-websockets)\nIf you want the proxy to handle also WebSockets, then you need to set the optional property `ws` to `true`, e.g.\n\n```yaml\n- name: backend-proxy-middleware\n  afterMiddleware: compression\n  configuration:\n    backend:\n      path: /sap\n      url: https://my.backend.example:1234\n    options:\n      ws: true\n```\n\n### [Changing the path to which a request is proxied](#changing-the-path-to-which-a-request-is-proxied)\nIf you want to configure the proxy to send requests from a certain path `/services/odata` to your backend (local url or destination) with a specified entry path `/my/entry/path`. Then you need to do the following:\n\n```yaml\n- name: backend-proxy-middleware\n  afterMiddleware: compression\n  configuration:\n    backend:\n      path: /services/odata\n      pathReplace: /my/entry/path\n      url: https://my.backend.example:1234\n      destination: my_example_destination\n```\n\n### [Providing Proxy Configuration](#providing-proxy-configuration)\nBy default the `backend-proxy-middleware` will read the proxy configuration from the OS environment variables `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` or from the Node.js environment variables `proxy`, `https-proxy` and `noproxy`. If those variables are not set, then you can also provide the proxy configuration in the `ui5.yaml` file.\n\n```yaml\n- name: backend-proxy-middleware\n  afterMiddleware: compression\n  configuration:\n    proxy: https://myproxy.example:8443\n    backend:\n      path: /sap\n      url: https://my.backend.example:1234\n\n```\n**Please note:** if you want to exclude any domains from the proxy then you will need to set the `noproxy` variable. E.g. if you want to exclude the `https://my.backend.example:1234` from the proxy you will need to set `noproxy` to `npm config set noproxy \".backend.example\"`. Note the leading `.`, if you provide only `backend.example`, then it will not work.\n\n### [Proxying Multiple Paths Backends](#proxying-multiple-paths-backends)\n\nTo connect to multiple backend or multiple paths of a backend, use multiple instances of the middleware.\n\n```yaml\n- name: backend-proxy-middleware\n  afterMiddleware: compression\n  configuration:\n    backend:\n      path: /my/path\n      url: https://my.backend.example:1234\n- name: backend-proxy-middleware\n  afterMiddleware: compression\n  configuration:\n    backend:\n      path: /my/other/path\n      url: https://my.backend.example:1234\n- name: backend-proxy-middleware\n  afterMiddleware: compression\n  configuration:\n    backend:\n      path: /my/path\n      url: https://other.backend.example:1234\n```\n\n## Programmatic Usage\nAlternatively you can only use the underlying proxy function, e.g. for the case when you want to use the `backend-proxy-middleware` functionality in your `express` server.\n\n```Typescript\nimport { createProxy } from '@sap-ux/backend-proxy-middleware';\nconst proxy = createProxy(backend, options);\n```\n- **config** - The backend configuration\n- **options** - Options of the [http-proxy-middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-proxy-middleware#options)\n\n## Keywords\n* Backend Proxy Middleware\n* Fiori tools\n* Fiori

[![Github repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-repo-blue)](https://github.com/SAP/open-ux-tools/tree/main/packages/ui5-proxy-middleware)\n\n# [`@sap-ux/ui5-proxy-middleware`](https://github.com/SAP/open-ux-tools/tree/main/packages/ui5-proxy-middleware)\n\nThe `@sap-ux/ui5-proxy-middleware` is a [Custom UI5 Server Middleware](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/extensibility/CustomServerMiddleware) for loading the UI5 sources in your application. It can be used either with the `ui5 serve` or the `fiori run` commands.\n\n## Configuration Options\n| Option       | Value Type    | Requirement Type | Default Value | Description |\n| ------------ | ------------- |------------- | ----------- |----------- |\n| `ui5`        | object  | optional | ---       | Configuration object for the UI5 proxy middleware |\n| `ui5.path`   |  string | optional | `/resources`, `/test-resources`       | Path that is to be proxied |\n| `ui5.url`     | string  | optional |`https://ui5.sap.com`      | URL pointing to the resources |\n| `ui5.pathReplace`| string  | optional | `undefined` | If provided then the path will be replaced with this value before forwarding |\n| `ui5.version`    | string  | optional |`undefined` | The UI5 version. If this property is not defined, then the `minUI5Version` from the `manifest.json` will be used |\n| `secure`     | boolean  | optional | true      | Defines if SSL certs should be verified |\n| `debug`      | boolean  | optional | false         | Enables debug output |\n| `proxy`      |  string | optional | `undefined`   | Use for adding corporate proxy configuration |\n| `directLoad` |  boolean | optional | false         | Defines whether the UI5 sources should be loaded directly from UI5 CDN |\n\n## Usage\nIn order to use the middleware this is the minimal configuration that you need to provide in the `ui5.yaml` of your application. All requests to `/resources` and `/test-resources` will be proxied to the latest UI5 version at https://ui5.sap.com.\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-proxy-middleware\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n### Defining url and path\nIf you want to explicitly define paths that should be proxied to a specific server, the following configuration is required.\n\n```Yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-proxy-middleware\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      ui5:\n      - path: /resources\n        url: https://ui5.sap.com\n      - path: /test-resources\n        url: https://ui5.sap.com\n```\n\nAlternatively you can use the following syntax if all paths should be proxied to the same URL.\n\n```Yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-proxy-middleware\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      ui5:\n        path: \n        - /resources\n        - /test-resources\n        url: https://ui5.sap.com\n```\n\n**NOTE: You can't mix the syntaxes!**\n\n### Loading a specific UI5 version\nTo load a specific UI5 version in your application you can use the `version` parameter, e.g.\n\n```Yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-proxy-middleware\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      ui5:\n      - path: /resources\n        url: https://ui5.sap.com\n      - path: /test-resources\n        url: https://ui5.sap.com\n      version: 1.96.1\n```\n\n### Loading UI5 sources directly from UI5 CDN\nIf you don't load all UI5 source through the `ui5-proxy-middleware`, then you can set `directLoad: true`. This will inject the absolute UI5 URL in the bootstrap of your HTML file, thus loading the libraries directly from UI5 CDN.\n\n**NOTE: this does not work with virtualized html files provided by the `preview-middleware`. In that case, call `npx @sap-ux/create add html` to generate a physical copy of the virtualized files.**\n\n```Yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-proxy-middleware\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      ui5:\n      - path: /resources\n        url: https://ui5.sap.com\n      - path: /test-resources\n        url: https://ui5.sap.com\n      directLoad: true\n```\n\n### Loading UI5 sources from a different Host\nIf you want to load UI5 sources from a different host, then you can set the property `pathReplace` to point to the desired resources. If provided then the `path` will be replaced with this value before forwarding.\n\n**NOTE: using `pathReplace` will not consider a specified UI5 version. If a specific UI5 version is needed, then it needs to be part of the `pathReplace`.**\n\n```Yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-proxy-middleware\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      ui5:\n      - path: /resources          \n        url: https://my.backend.example:1234\n        pathReplace: /sap/public/ui5/resources    \n```\n\n### Adding corporate proxy configuration\nBy default the `ui5-proxy-middleware` will read the proxy configuration from the OS environment variables `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` or from the Node.js environment variables `proxy`, `https-proxy`, and `noproxy`. If those variables are not set, then you can also provide the proxy configuration in the `ui5.yaml` file.\n\n```Yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-proxy-middleware\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      ui5:\n      - path: /resources\n        url: https://ui5.sap.com\n      - path: /test-resources\n        url: https://ui5.sap.com\n      proxy: https://my.corporate.proxy.example\n```\n**Please note:** if you want to exclude any domains from the proxy then you will need to set the `noproxy` variable. E.g. if you want to exclude the `https://ui5.sap.com` from the proxy you will need to set `noproxy` to `npm config set noproxy \".sap.com\"`. Note the leading `.`, if you provide only `sap.com`, then it will not work.\n\n## Programmatic Usage\nAlternatively you can only use the underlying proxy function, e.g. for the case when you want to incorporate the `ui5-proxy-middleware` functionality in your own middleware.\n\n```Typescript\nimport { Router } from 'express';\nimport { ui5Proxy } from '@sap-ux/ui5-proxy-middleware';\n\nconst router = Router();\nrouter.use(\"/resources/\", ui5Proxy({ path: \"/\", url: \"https://ui5.sap.com\"})/*, options, filter*/);\n```\n- **config** - The UI5 configuration\n- **options** - Options of the [http-proxy-middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-proxy-middleware#options)\n- **filter** - a custom function to determine which requests should be proxied or not, [example](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-proxy-middleware#context-matching)\n\n## Keywords\nUI5 Proxy

server for integration with AI coding assistants.\n\nThe server helps AI models create or modify SAP Fiori applications based on prompts, such as:\n\n- _Please add a SAP Fiori elements list report app to my CAP project_\n- _Generate a new CAP project and SAP Fiori app based on my_picture.png_\n- _Add the FCL to the SAP Fiori elements app_\n- _Enable initial load for the fiori app_\n\nFor the best experience we recommend using this server alongside [@cap-js/mcp-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cap-js/mcp-server) and [@ui5/mcp-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ui5/mcp-server).\n\n> ⚠️ Caution\n>\n> This is an experimental feature and may change at any time without notice.\n> It is not intended for productive use.\n> Please back up your data before using it.\n\n## [Usage](#usage)\n\n### Method 1: npx\n\nConfigure your MCP client to start the server with command `fiori-mcp`. Here is a sample configuration for Cline:\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"fiori-mcp\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"timeout\": 600,\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"--yes\",\"@sap-ux/fiori-mcp-server@latest\", \"fiori-mcp\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n### Method 2: npm\n\nFirst, install the required package globally using `npm`:\n```bash\nnpm install -g @sap-ux/fiori-mcp-server\n```\nThen, configure your MCP client to start the server with command `fiori-mcp`. Here is a sample configuration for Cline:\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"fiori-mcp\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"timeout\": 600,\n      \"command\": \"fiori-mcp\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## [Rules](#rules)\n\nThe following rules help guide the LLM to use the server correctly:\n\n```markdown\n## Rules for creation or modification of SAP Fiori elements apps\n\n- When asked to create an SAP Fiori elements app check whether the user input can be interpreted as an application organized into one or more pages containing table data or forms, these can be translated into a SAP Fiori elements application, else ask the user for suitable input.\n- The application typically starts with a List Report page showing the data of the base entity of the application in a table. Details of a specific table row are shown in the ObjectPage. This first Object Page is therefore based on the base entity of the application.\n- An Object Page can contain one or more table sections based on to-many associations of its entity type. The details of a table section row can be shown in an another Object Page based on the associations target entity.\n- The data model must be suitable for usage in a SAP Fiori elements frontend application. So there must be one main entity and one or more navigation properties to related entities.\n- Each property of an entity must have a proper datatype.\n- For all entities in the data model provide primary keys of type UUID.\n- When creating sample data in CSV files, all primary keys and foreign keys MUST be in UUID format (e.g., `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001`).\n- When generating or modifying the SAP Fiori elements application on top of the CAP service use the Fiori MCP server if available.\n- When attempting to modify the SAP Fiori elements application like adding columns you must not use the screen personalization but instead modify the code of the project, before this first check whether an MCP server provides a suitable function.\n- When previewing the SAP Fiori elements application use the most specific `npm run watch-*` script for the app in the `package.json`.\n```\n\nAdd these rules to your existing global or project-specific [`AGENTS.md`](https://agents.md/) (specifics may vary based on respective MCP client).\n\n## [Available Tools](#available-tools)\n\n#### `search_docs`\nSearches SAP Fiori elements, Annotations, UI5, SAP Fiori tools documentation for the given query.\n\nNote: the results are based on the most recent indexed version of UI5 documentation\n\n#### `list_fiori_apps`\nScans a specified directory to find existing SAP Fiori applications that can be modified.\n\n#### `list_functionalities` (Step 1 of 3)\nGets the list of supported functionalities to create a new or modify an existing SAP Fiori application.\n\nThe main functionalities are:\n\n- Generating a Fiori elements app within an [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)](https://cap.cloud.sap/) project\n- Adding and deleting pages from an app\n- Adding and modifying controller extensions\n- Modifying `manifest.json` properties depending on the app (e.g. adding Flexible Column Layout, enabling initial load)\n\n#### `get_functionality_details` (Step 2 of 3)\nGets the required parameters and detailed information for a specific functionality to create a new or modify an existing SAP Fiori application.\n\n#### `execute_functionality` (Step 3 of 3)\nExecutes a specific functionality to create a new or modify an existing SAP Fiori application with provided parameters.\n\n\n## [Telemetry](#telemetry)\n\nYou can enable and disable the collection of analytics. By default, non-personally identifiable information is used to help understand how you use the product to improve the Fiori MCP Server. In case you want to opt-out there exist two ways to disable the telemetry.\n\n### Method 1: Configuration File\n\nCreate or change the file `~/.fioritools/telemetrysettings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"telemetrysettings\": {\n    \"telemetrySetting\": {\n      \"enableTelemetry\": false\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSet `enableTelemetry` to `false` to disable telemetry collection.\n\n### Method 2: Environment Variable\n\nSet the environment variable `SAP_UX_FIORI_TOOLS_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` to `true`:\n\n```bash\nexport SAP_UX_FIORI_TOOLS_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true\n```\n\nSetting this environment variable will disable the telemetry client.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nEveryone participating in this joint project is welcome as long as our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/SAP/open-ux-tools/blob/main/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) is being adhered to.\n\n## Licensing\n\nPlease see our [LICENSE](./LICENSE) for copyright and license information.

Clone this repository and navigate into it\n    ```sh\n    git clone https://github.com/UI5/sample-app.git\n    cd sample-app\n    ```\n1. Install all dependencies\n    ```sh\n    npm install\n    ```\n\n1. Start a local server and run the application (http://localhost:8080/index.html)\n    ```sh\n    ui5 serve -o index.html\n    ```\n\n## Testing\n* Run [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) code validation\n    ```sh\n    npm run lint\n    ```\n* Start the [UI5 Test Runner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-test-runner) and execute the tests\n    ```sh\n    npm run test-ui5\n    ```\n* Run both ESLint and UI5 Test Runner\n    ```sh\n    npm test\n    ```\n## Building\n### Option 1: Standard preload build\n1. Execute the build\n    ```sh\n    ui5 build -a\n    ```\n1. Run the result\n    1. Run a local HTTP server on the build results (`/dist` directory)  \n\t(**Note:** This script is using the [local-web-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/local-web-server) npm module, but you can use any HTTP server for that)\n        ```sh\n        npm run serve-dist\n        ```\n    1. Open the app at http://localhost:8000\n\n### Option 2: Self-contained build\n1. (Optional) Remove previous build results\n   ```sh\n   rm -rf ./dist\n   ```\n1. Execute the `self-contained` build to create a bundle with all of your applications runtime dependencies\n    ```sh\n    ui5 build self-contained -a\n    ```\n1. Run the result\n    1. Run a local HTTP server on the build results (`/dist` directory)  \n\t(**Note:** This script is using the [local-web-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/local-web-server) npm module, but you can use any HTTP server for that)\n        ```sh\n        npm run serve-dist\n        ```\n    1. Open the app at http://localhost:8000\n\n## Working with local dependencies\n\nFor local development of your applications' dependencies (like OpenUI5 libraries) you can use [UI5 Workspaces](https://ui5.github.io/cli/stable/pages/Workspace/). This will allow you to make changes to those dependencies locally and see the impact in your application immediately.\n\n### Preparation\nThe following needs to be done just once per setup.\n\n1. Clone the OpenUI5 repository and navigate into it\n    **Note:** The UI5 version must be 1.65.0 or higher, you can check that in the root `package.json` file\n    ```sh\n    git clone https://github.com/UI5/openui5.git\n    cd openui5\n    ```\n1. Install all dependencies (this also links all OpenUI5 libraries between each other)\n    ```sh\n    npm install\n    ```\n\n### Setup UI5 Workspace\n\nWould you like to work on the application project and one or more of its UI5 framework dependencies at the same time? We got you covered!\n\n1. Create a new file `ui5-workspace.yaml` in the root folder of the project, right next to the `ui5.yaml`\n2. In `ui5-workspace.yaml`, add the paths to the local dependencies you'd like to use from your local machine:\n    ```yaml\n    specVersion: workspace/1.0\n    metadata:\n        name: default\n    dependencyManagement:\n        resolutions:\n            # local path to OpenUI5. It will resolve all required libraries and transitive dependencies.\n            - path: /local/path/to/openui5\n    ```\n3. Start the development server with default dependency resolution\n    ```sh\n    npm run start\n    ```\n\nYou can now make changes in your local OpenUI5 repository and see the impact directly when serving or building your application.\n\nIf a dependency that is listed in `ui5.yaml` is omitted in the `resolutions` section of `ui5-workspace.yaml`, the library is resolved in the usual way by downloading it from the registry. For more information about dependency resolutions, check [here](https://ui5.github.io/cli/stable/pages/Workspace/#dependency-management).\n\n#### Non-default workspace\n\nThe workspace feature always uses the `default` workspace and always attempts to resolve any dependencies from it.

It comes with an [explanation](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-cap-event-app/blob/typescript/docs/typescript.md) of what UI5 TypeScript code usually looks like and what to consider.\n- All *general information* about UI5 application development in TypeScript and links to tutorials, videos etc. can be found at https://sap.github.io/ui5-typescript.\n\n\n## Overview of TypeScript-related Entities\n\n- The UI5 type definitions (`*.d.ts` files) are loaded as dev dependency from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/openui5).\n- The file [tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json) contains the configuration for the TypeScript compilation, including a reference to the UI5 `*.d.ts` files.\n-  The TypeScript-to-JavaScript transpilation is done by [`ui5-tooling-transpile`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-tooling-transpile), which acts as both a build plugin (build results are stored in the `dist` folder) and middleware (the UI5 dev server transpiles the TypeScript files from `webapp` before sending it to the browser). Under the hood it uses the [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) transpiler.\n- In addition to the TypeScript compilation, there is also a conversion from the ES6 module and class syntax used in the source files to the classic UI5 module loading and class definition syntax (`sap.ui.require(...)`/`sap.ui.define(...)` and `SuperClass.extend(...)`). This conversion is also done by `ui5-tooling-transpile`, using the [babel-plugin-transform-modules-ui5](https://github.com/ui5-community/babel-plugin-transform-modules-ui5) project from the UI5 Community (initially developed by Ryan Murphy).\n\n## A Note on Testing\n\nThe main differences to tests written in JavaScript relate to a) writing OPA tests and b) configuring code coverage instrumentation:\n\nThe *structural* code differences to writing tests in *JavaScript* are:\n1. The **OPA Pages are simply classes extending `Opa5`, having the actions and assertions as class methods**.\n2. The **OPA Journeys do not use the `Given`/`When`/`Then` objects, but call actions and assertions directly on the Page objects**. \n\nThis simplifies the test code a lot and at the same time avoids type complications in TypeScript caused by OPA APIs not fitting a typed language. \nAll other testing code is converted from JavaScript in the same way as regular application code is (i.e. using real ECMAScript classes and modules).\n\nThe *setup* difference is in the configuration to instrument code for coverage reporting: the `istanbul` library needs to be added to the Babel config of `ui5-tooling-transpile-middleware` in `ui5.yaml`.\n\nDetails can be found in the later sections of [step-by-step.md](step-by-step.md).\n\n> Note: the test setup is now using the [`ui5-test-runner`](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/ui5-test-runner) instead of deprecated `karma`.\n\n\n## Requirements\n\nEither [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for dependency management.\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Clone the project:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-helloworld.git\ncd ui5-typescript-helloworld\n```\n\n(or download from https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-helloworld/archive/main.zip)\n\n2. Use npm (or any other package manager) to install the dependencies:\n\n```sh\nnpm install\n```\n\n## Run the App\n\nExecute the following command to run the app locally for development in watch mode (the browser reloads the app automatically when there are changes in the source code):\n\n```sh\nnpm start\n```\n\nAs shown in the terminal after executing this command, the app is then running on http://localhost:8080/index.html. A browser window with this URL should automatically open.\n\n## Debug the App\n\nIn the browser, you can directly debug the original TypeScript code, which is supplied via sourcemaps (need to be enabled in the browser's developer console if it does not work straight away). If the browser doesn't automatically jump to the TypeScript code when setting breakpoints, use e.g. `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `P` in Chrome to open the `*.ts` file you want to debug.\n\n## Run the Tests\n\nThe tests can be executed either manually or in an automated way using [`ui5-test-runner`](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/ui5-test-runner):\n\n1. *Manual execution*: use `npm start` and then execute the tests by opening the [testsuite](http://localhost:8080/test/testsuite.qunit.html) at [http://localhost:8080/test/testsuite.qunit.html](http://localhost:8080/test/testsuite.qunit.html) in your browser. You can also directly launch the [QUnit tests](http://localhost:8080/test/Test.qunit.html?testsuite=test-resources/ui5/typescript/helloworld/testsuite.qunit&test=unit/unitTests) or the [Integration tests](http://localhost:8080/test/Test.qunit.html?testsuite=test-resources/ui5/typescript/helloworld/testsuite.qunit&test=integration/opaTests) individually.\n<!-- 2. *Test-driven* development by running Karma in watch mode using `npm run karma` (which triggers the test each time a source file changes) -->\n2. *Headless testing*: launch test-runner either *without* coverage reporting using `npm run test-runner` or *with* coverage using `npm run test-runner-coverage`.\nWhile the tests are running, their status can be monitored at http://localhost:8081/_/progress.html\n\n> Note: when the application to test is passed using the `--url` argument (as we do it in this sample), then there is [no \"watch\" mode of the ui5-test-runner so far](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/ui5-test-runner/issues/119), which automatically re-runs the tests when a resource changes. \n\n## Build the App\n\n### Unoptimized (but quick)\n\nExecute the following command to build the project and get an app that can be deployed:\n\n```sh\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThe result is placed into the `dist` folder. To start the generated package, just run\n\n```sh\nnpm run start:dist\n```\n\nNote that `index.html` still loads the UI5 framework from the relative URL `resources/...`, which does not physically exist, but is only provided dynamically by the UI5 tooling. So for an actual deployment you should change this URL to either [the CDN](https://sdk.openui5.org/#/topic/2d3eb2f322ea4a82983c1c62a33ec4ae) or your local deployment of UI5.\n\n### Optimized\n\nFor an optimized self-contained build (takes longer because the UI5 resources are built, too), do:\n\n```sh\nnpm run build:opt\n```\n\nTo start the generated package, again just run\n\n```sh\nnpm run start:dist\n```\n\nIn this case, all UI5 framework resources are also available within the `dist` folder, so the folder can be deployed as-is to any static web server, without changing the bootstrap URL.<br>\nWith the self-contained build, the bootstrap URL in `index.html` has already been modified to load the newly created `sap-ui-custom.js` for bootstrapping, which contains all app resources as well as all needed UI5 JavaScript resources. Most UI5 resources inside the `dist` folder are for this reason actually **not** needed to run the app. Only the non-JS-files, like translation texts and CSS files, are used and must also be deployed. (Only when for some reason JS files are missing from the optimized self-contained bundle, they are also loaded separately.)\n\n## Check the Code\n\nDo the following to run a TypeScript check:\n\n```sh\nnpm run ts-typecheck\n```\n\nThis checks the application code for any type errors (but will also complain in case of fundamental syntax issues which break the parsing).<br>\n\nTo lint the TypeScript code, do:\n\n```sh\nnpm run lint\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\n- At this time, the used eslint rules are not verified to be optimal or to be in sync with UI5 recommendations.\n- In the future there might be further improvements to how tests are written and configured.\n\n## Known Issues\n\nNone.\n\n## How to Obtain Support\n\nThe sample code is provided **as-is**. No support is provided.\n\n[Create an issue](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-helloworld/issues) in this repository if you find a bug in the sample app code or documentation.\n\nFor issues in the UI5 type definitions which are caused by the dts-generator please open [issues in the dts-generator's repository](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-typescript/issues).<br>\n\nIssues in the UI5 type definitions which are also present in the [API documentation](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api) originate from the JSDoc comments in the original OpenUI5/SAPUI5 code, so please directly open an [OpenUI5](https://github.com/SAP/openui5/issues)/SAPUI5 ticket for those.\n\nQuestions can be [asked in SAP Community](https://answers.sap.com/questions/ask.html).\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2023-2025 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.

This conversion is using the [babel-plugin-transform-modules-ui5](https://github.com/r-murphy/babel-plugin-transform-modules-ui5) project from Ryan Murphy. |\n| Both, the TypeScript compilation and the ES6 syntax transformation, are executed by Babel, as configured in the file [.babelrc.json](.babelrc.json) |\n| This combined transformation is triggered by both the `build:ts` and `watch:ts` scripts in [package.json](package.json). |\n\n## Project setup\nPNPM as package manager for monorepo\n\nSeparate packages for:\n - UI5 application: packages/ui/\n - UI5 library: packages/library/\n - CAP server: packages/server/\n\nCAP server is proxied by UI5 application\n\nUI5 application depends on the UI5 library project which is consumed as regular dependency\n\n![Project setup Image](./images/project.png)\n\n## UI setup\nThis UI app demonstrates on how to get the most out of TypeScript using classes, generic types and much more. This is all explained in details in the following blog post: https://blogs.sap.com/2021/12/07/my-first-experience-with-typescript-in-ui5-classes-and-state-model-manager/\n\nThe app is separated in multiple layers:\n - Service layer which handles the communication to the backend\n - Data model layer which contains a virtual replication of the data model in the backend and handles everything related to the internal data model\n - View/controller will be dedicated to handle user interaction\n\n![UI setup image](./images/ui-structure.png)\n\n## UI Library\nMore information regarding custom UI5 Libraries and custom controls can be found here: https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-control-library\n\n## Testing\nThe end-to-end tests are done by using WDI5: https://github.com/ui5-community/wdi5\n\n## Requirements\n\n[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for dependency management.\n\n## Preparation\n\nUse `npm` to install the dependencies:\n\n```sh\nnpm i\n```\n\n## Run the App\n\nExecute the following command to run the app locally for development in watch mode (the browser reloads the app automatically when there are changes in the source code):\n\n```sh\nnpm start\n```\n\nAs shown in the terminal after executing this command, the app is then running on http://localhost:8080/index.html.

This also helps keeping your credentials from being committed.\n\nThis middleware will look in that directory for one (or many) json file(s) with a specific structure (check the [example json](templates/destinations.json)).\n\nAs an alternative, the middleware will also look for destination files in the created directory. The structure of these files is the same as the one used in [WebIDE destination files](https://help.sap.com/viewer/825270ffffe74d9f988a0f0066ad59f0/CF/en-US/2cf47f37e34c428c97a51057733c0394.html) (also check the [example template](templates/webide-destination)).\n\nFor the time being, the only properties required in a destination configuration are **`Name`, `URL`, `User`, `Password` and `WebIDEUsage`**.\n\n*NOTE: Storing passwords in plain text format ***is a potential security risk***. Please comply with your organization's policy.*\n\n\n## Options for SAPUI5 config in destinations file\n```jsonc\n{\n  \"Name\": \"sapui5\", // Name is used as an identifier\n  \"Description\": \"SAPUI5 Resources\",\n  \"URL\": \"C:\\\\Dev\\\\workspace\\\\sapui5\\\\sdk\", // Can be used to specify cdn URL e.g. https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/\n  \"preferLocal\": false // Flag to determine whether the resources files will be served from local system or cdn remote server\n}\n```\n\n## Usage\n### 1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`\n\n```jsonc\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-destination\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n},\n\"ui5\": {\n  \"dependencies\": [\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-destination\",\n    // ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> As the devDependencies are not recognized by the UI5 tooling, they need to be listed in the `ui5.dependencies` array. In addition, once using the `ui5.dependencies` array you need to list all UI5 tooling relevant dependencies.\n\n### 2. Configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`\n\n#### Simplest usage:\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-middleware-destination\n      afterMiddleware: cors\n      configuration:\n  \t    destinationsPath: '../path/to/destination/files'\n```\n\n#### Example config serving from CDN:\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-middleware-destination\n      afterMiddleware: cors\n      configuration:\n        debug: true\n        destinationsPath: '../path/to/destination/files'\n        resources:\n          preferLocal: false\n          path: 'https://path/to/CDN/resources'\n```\n\n#### Example config serving from an ABAP AS with self-signed certificate:\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-middleware-destination\n      afterMiddleware: cors\n      configuration:\n        debug: true\n        destinationsPath: '../path/to/destination/files'\n        resources:\n          preferLocal: false\n          path: 'https://<host>:<port>/path/to/ABAP/AS/resources'\n        strictSSL: false\n```\n\n#### Example config serving from local resources:\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-middleware-destination\n      afterMiddleware: cors\n      configuration:\n        destinationsPath: '../path/to/destination/files'\n        resources:\n          preferLocal: true\n          path: '../local/path/to/resources'\n```\n\n## Configuration options\n**ATTENTION:** No options are mandatory, EXCEPT for **`destinationsPath`**. This option **must** be provided either in the `ui5.yml` file or as an environment variable (as in the description below).\n\n> Note that relative paths declared in these options are resolved against the project's root.\n\n* **`debug`** *(boolean, default:* `false`*)*  \nEnables the logging of each request and where it is served from.\n\n* **`destinationsPath`** *(string)*  \nAbsolute or relative path to the [destination files](#pre-requisites).  \nIf a relative path is provided, it is resolved against the project's root folder.  \nIf you do not provide this option in the `ui5.yml` file, you **must** set the `UI5_MIDDLEWARE_DESTINATIONS_PATH` environment variable. \n\n* **`strictSSL`** *(boolean, default:* `true`*)*  \nWhen set to false, the proxy does not validate SSL certificates of the resource server.  \nThis covers the use case of, for example, serving routes from a corporate ABAP AS with a self-signed certificate.\n\n* **`resources`** *(object)*  \nOptions regarding SAPUI5 resources:\n\n  * **`path`** *(string)*  \n  If `preferLocal` is `true`, then this is the local absolute or relative path to SAPUI5 resources.  \n  When `preferLocal` is `false`, you can provide a CDN URL for the SAPUI5 resources. or [https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com) will be used as CDN source  \n  This option can be provided either in the `ui5.yml` file or through the `UI5_MIDDLEWARE_RESOURCES_PATH` environment variable.\n  \n  * **`preferLocal`** *(boolean, default:* `false`*)*  \n  When `true`, middleware redirects all the ui5 resources requests to local filesystem.\n  This option can be provided through `UI5_MIDDLEWARE_RESOURCES_LOCAL` environment variable. Possible values in environment variable can be `0` or `1`.\n\n## How it works\n* Integrates [node-http-proxy](https://github.com/http-party/node-http-proxy) to proxy requests to remote server using the [destination files](#pre-requisites).\n* Integrates [serve-static](https://github.com/expressjs/serve-static) to serve static resources from a local path.\n\n## Limitations\nCurrently only BasicAuthentication is supported.\n\n## Contribution Guidelines\nPull Request are welcome. However, if change is complex or huge, Please create an issue and have a discussion on the approach before developing something.\n\n## Contributors\n- [Preetam](https://github.com/preetamkajalrout)\n- [Leonardo](https://github.com/leo-ls)\n\n## LICENSE\nProject is distributed under [MIT License](LICENSE)","jsdoc":{},"downloadsCurrentMonth":32,"downloadsCurrentFortnight":9,"downloads365":473,"downloadsFortnightGrowth":-60.87,"downloadsHistory":[{"yearMonth":"2025-01","downloads":38},{"yearMonth":"2025-02","downloads":18},{"yearMonth":"2025-03","downloads":34},{"yearMonth":"2025-04","downloads":32},{"yearMonth":"2025-05","downloads":36},{"yearMonth":"2025-06","downloads":35},{"yearMonth":"2025-07","downloads":60},{"yearMonth":"2025-08","downloads":40},{"yearMonth":"2025-09","downloads":66},{"yearMonth":"2025-10","downloads":46},{"yearMonth":"2025-11","downloads":39}],"npmlink":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-destination","versions":[{"version":"created","date":"2019-09-22T17:42:49.316Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-destination/v/created","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"1.0.0","date":"2019-09-22T17:42:49.461Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-destination/v/1.0.0","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"modified","date":"2022-05-22T16:28:46.512Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-destination/v/modified","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"1.0.1","date":"2019-09-22T17:47:03.549Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-destination/v/1.0.1","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"1.0.2","date":"2019-09-22T18:14:11.879Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-destination/v/1.0.2","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"1.0.3","date":"2020-05-11T15:24:01.235Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-destination/v/1.0.3","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"1.1.1","date":"2020-07-19T23:03:39.618Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-destination/v/1.1.1","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"1.1.2","date":"2020-07-20T19:35:23.636Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-destination/v/1.1.2","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"2.0.1","date":"2020-07-21T09:59:59.129Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-destination/v/2.0.1","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"2.0.2","date":"2020-07-21T10:07:12.473Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-destination/v/2.0.2","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"}]},{"name":"bestofui5-website","version":"0.15.0","description":"bestofui5-website -

This is generated after each commit in `main` branch.  \n![Best Of UI5 Diagramm](img/BestOfUI5_Architecture.png)\n\n## Frontend\n\nThe frontend is generated with the [UI5-TS-App Generator](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-ts-app) and written completly in TypeScript.\nIn the folder `src` is the source code.\n\n### External Dependencies\n\nWe use two external modules (`ui5-cc-md` and `chart.js`) that are integrated in two different ways.\n\n#### `ui5-cc-md`\n\nFor each package we load the `README.md` to show it on the object page.  \nTo render this we use [`ui5-cc-md`](https://github.com/ui5-community/ui5-cc-md) integrated via NPM.  \nTo use this simply install `ui5-cc-md` and add `ui5-cc-md` to your `package.json` at [\"ui5\"-->\"dependencies\"](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-website/blob/5a33b4b710d8143f1d07195bba9ca28696871995/package.json#L77-L82).  \nNow we can use simply use this in the [`Object.view.xml`](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-website/blob/5a33b4b710d8143f1d07195bba9ca28696871995/src/view/Object.view.xml#L94) to render the markdown.\n\n#### `chart.js`\n\nWe also get the historical download data from all npm packages.  \nTo display this data we use [`chart.js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chart.js) in the in the `Object.view.xml`.  \nTo use this library install via NPM [`ui5-tooling-modules`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-tooling-modules) and `chart.js`.  \nAs template to integrate `chart.js` we use almost the same implementation from [@akudev](https://github.com/akudev) in this tutorial:\n[ui5-typescript-tutorial - Using NPM Packages](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-tutorial/tree/main/exercises/ex8)  \nFor a better usage we create a [custom control](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-website/blob/main/src/control/BarChart.ts) to use a bar chart.\nNow we can use this chart in the [`Object.view.xml#L61-L63`](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-website/blob/5a33b4b710d8143f1d07195bba9ca28696871995/src/view/Object.view.xml#L83-L85) to display the data.\n\n### UI5 Web Components\n\nEven though the [UI5 Web Components](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/) were originally intended for use outside of the UI5 framework, the components are now integrated into the OpenUI5 framework.  \nThey will replace the standard controls in the long run and therefore it makes sense to use them already.  \nAs a use case, we wanted to display the individual released versions of the NPM packages sorted by date.  \nIn [SAPUI5 there is a timeline](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.suite.ui.commons.Timeline) for this, but unfortunately not in OpenUI5, however in the [UI5 web components](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/playground/components/Timeline/) there is.  \nTo use the UI5 web components, [@petermuessig](https://github.com/petermuessig) has already written a [detailed blog](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/03/10/ui5-web-components-enablement-for-openui5-sapui5/) about it.  \nThrough direct integration with OpenUI5 the use is as simple as any other control [`Timeline.view.xml#L18-L37`](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-website/blob/5a33b4b710d8143f1d07195bba9ca28696871995/src/view/Timeline.view.xml#L18-L37)\n\n### Build & Deployment\n\nBuild is automated with GitHub Actions.  \nOn every push to `main`, the [`build`](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-website/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml) workflow is triggered.  \nThis will transpile typescript to javascript and run `ui5 build self-contained --all`.  \nThe result will be moved to the new folder [`docs`](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-website/tree/docs) and force pushed to the `docs` branch.  \nFrom there, GitHub Pages will automatically deploy the new version to the webpage <https://bestofui5.org/> .\n\n### Testing\n\nWe run [`wdi5`](https://github.com/js-soft/wdi5) tests on every Pull Request.  \nImplicitly, the build is also tested before the wdi5 tests, since it is executed before the tests.  \nThe tests are located in the [`test`](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-website/tree/main/src/test) folder.  \nWe run the tests with [mock data](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-website/tree/main/src/localService) to make sure we get consistent results on the tests.\n\n## Backend\n\n**The backend is located in a seperate repository [`bestofui5-data`](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-data#readme).**  \n**For a more detailed documentation read the readme there.**\n\nWe crawl data from GitHub and NPM.  \nThe source code is written in typescript and in folder [`src`](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-data/tree/main/src).\nIt creates two json files (`data`, `versions`) which will be used as a model in the UI5 App.  \nThe latest update of the files are located in the [`data`](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-data/tree/live-data/data) folder on the `live-data` branch.\nThe frontend is using these raw files [directly from the branch](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-website/blob/5a33b4b710d8143f1d07195bba9ca28696871995/src/manifest.json#L17-L27).  \nThe packages are crawled from are located in [`sources.json`](https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-data/blob/main/sources.json).\n\n## DevOps\n\n### Deployment of Pull Requests to Azure Static Web Apps\n\nIn order for contributors to better understand the impact of a pull request and to better test it, there is an option to deploy the changes of a pull request into a test environment, using [Azure Static Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-en/services/app-service/static/#overview).  \nThis makes it easy to access and test the app.  \n**For security reasons, this only works for pull requests from the `ui5-community` repo.**\n\n#### How To\n\n- **Create**: To initiate the deployment to Azure Static Web Apps, the label `deploy_test` must be assigned to a pull request.  \n  - If this was successful, a comment is left in the pull request with the link to the app.  \n- **Update**: After the label is added, each commit initiates an update to the Azure Static Web App.\n  - If this label is not present on the pull request, the GitHub actions will be skipped every time.  \n- **Delete**: If the pull request is closed (manually or via merge), the Azure Static Web App is also deleted.\n  -  Do not remove the label, otherwise the app will not be deleted!\n\n## Run local\n\n### Requirements\n\nEither [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for dependency management.\n\ngit clone:\n`> git clone https://github.com/ui5-community/bestofui5-website`\n\nInstall:\n`> npm install`\n\nStart UI5 App:\n`> npm start`\n\n## Changelog\n\nView the [Changelog

Welcome to the CAP SFLIGHT App\n\nThis is a sample app for the travel reference scenario, built with the [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)](https://cap.cloud.sap) and [SAP Fiori Elements](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/smart-templates).\n\nThe purpose of this sample app is to:\n* Demonstrate SAP Fiori annotations\n* Demonstrate and compare SAP Fiori features on various stacks (CAP Node.js, CAP Java SDK, ABAP)\n* Run UI test suites on various stacks\n\n![Process Travels Page](.github/assets/img.png)\n\nThe app still contains some workarounds that are going to be addressed over time.\nIn some cases, the model and the handlers can be improved or simplified once further planned CAP features become available.\nIn other cases, the app itself could be improved. For example, calculation of the total price for a travel\ncurrently simply sums up the single prices ignoring the currencies.\n\n> For enabling all features of the Analytical List Page (ALP) in the Node.js runtime, we have switched on the new OData parser\n(`odata_new_parser: true` in `package.json`), which is still in an **experimental state**.\nEarly adopters may use this feature in own projects on their own risk.\nYou can also use the ALP with the standard OData parser, but then some features like grouping in the table are not available.\n\n![](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cap-sflight/workflows/CI/badge.svg)\n[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/cap-sflight)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/cap-sflight)\n\n\n## Run locally\n\n### Build and Run - Node.js Backend\n\nPrerequisite:\n```\nnpm i -g @sap/cds-dk\n```\n\nIn the root folder of your project, run\n```\nnpm ci\ncds watch\n```\n\n#### Accessing the SAP Fiori Apps\n\nOpen these links in your browser:\n* http://localhost:4004/sap.fe.cap.travel/index.html for processing the travel data\n* http://localhost:4004/sap.fe.cap.travel_analytics/index.html for the [Analytical List Page](https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/3d33684b08ca4490b26a844b6ce19b83) (ALP)\n\n\n### Build and Run - Java Backend\n\nIn the root folder of your project, run\n```\nnpm ci\nnpm run build:ui\nmvn spring-boot:run\n```\n\n> At the moment, there is no watch mode for Fiori UI changes.  Run `npm run build:ui` after each change there.\n\n#### Accessing the SAP Fiori Apps\n\nOpen these links in your browser:\n* http://localhost:4004/travel_processor/dist/index.html for processing the travel data\n* http://localhost:4004/travel_analytics/dist/index.html for the [Analytical List Page](https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/3d33684b08ca4490b26a844b6ce19b83) (ALP)\n\nLog in with user `amy` and empty password.\n\n### Integration Tests\n\nTo start OPA tests, open this link in your browser:\nhttp://localhost:4004/travel_processor/webapp/test/integration/Opa.qunit.html\n\nTest documentation is available at:\nhttps://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.fe.test\n\n## Deployment to SAP Business Technology Platform\n\nThe project contains a configuration for deploying the CAP services and the SAP Fiori app to the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) using a managed application router. The app then becomes visible in the content manager of the SAP Build Work Zone.\n\nThe configuration file `mta.yaml` is for the Node.js backend of the app. If you want to deploy the Java backend, copy `mta-java.yaml` to `mta.yaml`.\n\n### Prerequisites\n#### SAP Business Technology Platform\n\n- Create a [trial account on SAP BTP](https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform/trial.html). See this [tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html) for more information. Alternatively, you can use a sub-account in a productive environment.\n- Get a [SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/get-your-tenant?version=Cloud#get-trial-tenant) and [establish trust](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/establish-trust-and-federation-between-uaa-and-identity-authentication?version=Cloud)\n- Subscribe to the [SAP Build Work Zone](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-portal-cloud-foundry-getting-started.html).\n- Create an [SAP HANA Cloud Service instance](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hana-cloud-mission-trial-2.html) or use an existing one. Then, [provision an instance](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hana-cloud-mission-trial-3.html) - make sure to choose the Cloud Foundry Runtime environment.\n\n#### Local Machine\n\n- Install the Cloud Foundry command line interface (CLI). See this [tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-cf-download-cli.html) for more details.\n- Install the [MultiApps CF CLI Plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/multiapps-cli-plugin):\n\n  ```shell\n  cf add-plugin-repo CF-Community https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org\n  cf install-plugin multiapps\n  ```\n\n- Install the [Cloud MTA Build Tool](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-mta-build-tool) globally:\n\n  ```shell\n  npm install -g mbt\n   ```\n\n### Build the Project\n\nBuild the project from the command line:\n\n```shell\nmbt build\n```\n\nThe build results will be stored in the directory `mta_archives`.\n\n### Deploy\n\n1. Log in to the target space.\n2. Deploy the MTA archive using the CF CLI: `cf deploy mta_archives/capire.sflight_1.0.0.mtar`\n\n### Assign Role Collection\n\nAny authorized user has read access to the app. For further authorization, assign a role collection to your user in the SAP BTP Cockpit:\n* `sflight-reviewer-{spacename}` for executing actions *Accept Travel*, *Reject Travel*, and *Deduct Discount*\n* `sflight-processor-{spacename}` for full write access\n\n### Integrate SFlight with SAP Build Work Zone, Standard Edition\n\nCAP SFlight uses the managed AppRouter, which in case of a trial account, is provided by the Navigation Service in SAP Build Work Zone, Standard Edition. Please consult [this tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/integrate-with-work-zone.html) to make sure that your Build Work Zone is configured correctly to serve the CAP SFlight Frontend.\n\n### Local Development with a HANA Cloud Instance\n\nYou need to have access to a HANA Cloud instance and SAP BTP.\n\n1. Deploy the HDI content to a HANA HDI container (which is newly created on first call): `cds deploy --to hana`.\n2. Start the application with the Spring Profile `cloud`.\n   1.

Some highlights:\n\n- generation of TypeScript files or compiled JS / DTS files\n- name or rename stuff\n  - naming of pretty much any aspect of the generated artefacts\n  - e.g. all types should be prefixed with an \"I\", Person => IPerson\n  - consistent casing (as in \"camelCase\" or \"PascalCase\") even for property names of entity types\n- use type converters\n\nSee the [generator documentation](https://odata2ts.github.io/docs/generator/setup-and-usage) for more information.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev @odata2ts/odata2ts\n```\n\n### Implicit Dependencies\n\nMost of the generated artefacts depend on other libraries. `odata2ts` lists them as peer dependencies.\n\nDepending on your use case, you will need to add runtime dependencies matching the mentioned peer dependencies.\nSee the [Getting Started Guide](https://odata2ts.github.io/docs/category/getting-started/) of the documentation\nfor guidance.\n\n## Documentation\n\n[Generator Documentation](https://odata2ts.github.io/docs/generator/setup-and-usage)\n\nMain documentation for the odata2ts eco system:\n[https://odata2ts.github.io](https://odata2ts.github.io/)\n\n## Examples\n\nSee [example packages](https://github.com/odata2ts/odata2ts/tree/main/examples) for examples of how to integrate `odata2ts`.\n\n## Tests\n\nSee folder [test](https://github.com/odata2ts/odata2ts/tree/main/packages/odata2ts/test)\nfor unit tests.\n\nSee folder [int-test](https://github.com/odata2ts/odata2ts/tree/main/packages/odata2ts/int-test) for integration\ntests of the CLI.\n\nEach example package serves as integration test of the generator.\n\n## Support, Feedback, Contributing\n\nThis project is open to feature requests, suggestions, bug reports, usage questions etc.\nvia [GitHub issues](https://github.com/odata2ts/odata2ts/issues).\n\nContributions and feedback are encouraged and always welcome.\n\nSee the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/odata2ts/odata2ts/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for further information.\n\n## Spirit\n\nThis project and this module have been created and are maintained in the following spirit:\n\n- adhere to the **OData specification** as much as possible\n  - support any OData service implementation which conforms to the spec\n  - allow to work around faulty implementations if possible\n- stability matters\n  - exercise Test Driven Development\n  - bomb the place with unit tests (code coverage > 95%)\n  - ensure that assumptions & understanding are correct by creating integration tests\n\n## License\n\nMIT - see

properties representing related services: no prefix anymore, just the name of the property as function (previously, prefix `navTo`).\n\nRemoved `get` method of EntitySetServices: use property directly instead.\n\nRemoved the following naming options regarding generated services: `serviceResolverFunction`, `publicProps`\n\n#

Navigation is done via paging.\n\n![Pagiantor preview](preview.PNG)\n\n## Motivation\nWe use openUI5 on the client side as the base technology for our product \"sysHUB\". On the server side, we are using our REST-based API.\nThe main thing is that we are working with large table entries. The base technology of openUI5 and sapUI5 is oData V4 to get data from the backend.\nIn our case, this is not a good choice because we are providing some REST-Services for our customers, and we can not implement REST-Services \nand oData Services to the same time in our product. In an earlier version of openUI5, a paginator was included, but it was removed since 1.45 (I think). \nWe are going on to develop the paginator to work with all newer versions and extend it with some valuable features.\n\n\n## Demo\n\nIf you check out this project, there is a \"demo\" app to see how the paginator works. We are using WebStorm as a development IDE.\nConfigure it as a \"JavaScript Debug\" run configuration to debug the demo app.\n\nYou can also use this link to see a working example:  [openui5-paginator-demo](https://wolfe100.github.io/)\n\n## Usage the control\n\n### Download\n\nCheck out the GIT-Project or download it as ZIP. Furthermore the package is deployed also in NPM\n\n    npm install openui5-paginator\n\n### Configure manifest.json\n\nAdd the library to sap.ui5 dependencies list and configure the resourceRoots to point where you uploaded the custom library.\nIn this case it is the \"thirdparty\" folder in your project. This folder must be in the webapp root location.\n\n```json\n\"sap.ui5\": {\n    ...\n\t\"dependencies\": {\n\t\t\"minUI5Version\": \"1.102.2\",\n\t\t\"libs\": {\n    \t\t...\n\t\t\t\"syshub.controls\": {}\n\t\t}\n\t},\n\t\"resourceRoots\": {\n\t\t\"syshub.controls\": \"./thirdparty/syshub/controls/\"\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Add the custom control inside an XML View\n\nFirst of all add the namespace to the View\n\n```xml\nxmlns:lab=\"syshub.controls\"\nxmlns:t=\"sap.ui.table\"\n\n```\n\nAnd then you can simply add the Paginator custom control to your \"sap.ui.table\". As followed you can see some data bindings.\n\n```xml\n<t:Table ...>\n    <t:footer>\n        <lab:Paginator id=\"idPaginator\"\n                       currentPage=\"{modelEntriesMetadata>/currentPage}\"\n                       entriesAbsolute=\"{modelEntriesMetadata>/entriesAbsolute}\"\n                       entriesPerPage=\"{modelEntriesMetadata>/entriesPerPage}\"\n                       numberOfVisiblePages=\"10\"\n                       showGoto=\"true\"\n                       entriesPerPageVisible = \"true\"\n                       showSpinner=\"{modelEntriesMetadata>/showSpinner}\"\n                       page=\"onPage\"\n                       entriesPerPageChanged = \"onEntriesPerPageChanged\">\n        </lab:Paginator>\n    <t:footer>\n    <t:columns>\n        ...\n    </t:columns>\n</t:Table>\n```\n\n## Parameters\n\n| Name                 | Type   \t| Default | Description\n|:---------------------|:----------\t|:--------| :-----------|\n| currentPage          | number \t| 0       | The current selected page or the page to set\n| entriesAbsolute      | number \t| 0       | The absolute count of the entires given by the query\n| showGoto             | boolean   \t| false   | Shows the direct GOTO input field\n| entriesPerPage       | int    \t| 10      | How much entries should shown of each page\n| numberOfVisiblePages | number\t\t| 10      | How much pages shown which are directly selectable\n| showSpinner          | boolean   \t| false   | Shows a spinner to give the user information to get data from the server\n\n## Events\n\n### entriesPerPageChanged\n| Parameter | Type | Description\n|:----------|:-----| :---------  |\n| offset    | int  | The offset where to start the new query\n| limit     | int  | The new limit is how many entries must be get\n\n### page\n| Parameter  | Type | Description\n|:-----------|:-----| :---------  |\n| srcPage    | int  | The page which is the current one before the page event is fired (and another page is displayed)\n| targetPage | int  | The page that shall be displayed next after the page event is fired\n| offset     | int  | The offset where to start the new query\n| limit      | int  | The limit how many entries must get\n| type      | syshub.controls.PaginatorEvent  | Provides the values 'First', 'Last', 'Next', 'Previous', 'Goto'.

This means we got a snapshot view of the table\nand got in the response header the \"abs_count\" and the \"highest_id\". All queries while paging\nlimited the query in the search criteria with the highest_id. The reason for this is, that growing up the table\nwith new entries will destroy paging if we don't have the highest_id in the search criteria.\n\n### Known issues\nOne problem which we don't found a solution is removing of entries while paging. This means, \nif another instance removes entries which are included in the query, the result is different, regarding\nthe abs_count and the computing of paging can run in some problems but we live with this limitation.\nOne idear can be, if while paing the abs_count changed the current page can be set to the first one. \n\nPlease have a look of the DataService.js and the mockserver.js to understand how paging is working.\n\n## Important\nIf the value \"entriesAbsolute\" = 0, the paginator is not shown. Be sure, to set this value after a query.\n\n## Credits\n\nWolfgang Haag\n\n - Email: [whaag@nt-ware.com](whaag@nt-ware.com)\n\n## License\nThis project is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details\n","downloadsCurrentMonth":39,"downloadsCurrentFortnight":23,"downloads365":174,"downloadsFortnightGrowth":43.75,"downloadsHistory":[{"yearMonth":"2025-01","downloads":10},{"yearMonth":"2025-02","downloads":4},{"yearMonth":"2025-03","downloads":11},{"yearMonth":"2025-04","downloads":11},{"yearMonth":"2025-05","downloads":6},{"yearMonth":"2025-06","downloads":6},{"yearMonth":"2025-07","downloads":9},{"yearMonth":"2025-08","downloads":2},{"yearMonth":"2025-09","downloads":34},{"yearMonth":"2025-10","downloads":17},{"yearMonth":"2025-11","downloads":28}],"npmlink":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/openui5-paginator","versions":[{"version":"created","date":"2022-07-27T15:31:26.879Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/openui5-paginator/v/created","changelog":"","sourceType":"library"},{"version":"1.0.0","date":"2022-07-27T15:31:27.113Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/openui5-paginator/v/1.0.0","changelog":"","sourceType":"library"},{"version":"modified","date":"2022-07-27T15:31:27.297Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/openui5-paginator/v/modified","changelog":"","sourceType":"library"}]},{"name":"generator-easy-ui5","version":"3.8.2","description":"Generator for UI5-based project","main":"generators/app/index.js","type":"command","files":["generators","plugins"],"engines":{"node":">=20"},"scripts":{"prepublishOnly":"npx yo@5.1.0 ./generators/app/index.js project --embed","start":"yo easy-ui5 project","test":"mocha","test:subgen:list":"yo easy-ui5 project --list","test:subgen:start":"yo easy-ui5 project app","release:changelog":"conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s -r 0","postversion":"npm run release:changelog && git commit --all --amend --no-edit","lint":"eslint .","lint:fix":"eslint . --fix","lint:staged":"lint-staged","format":"prettier --write .","format:staged":"pretty-quick --staged --verbose","prepare":"node ./.husky/skip.js || husky install","hooks:commit-msg":"commitlint -e","hooks:pre-commit":"npm-run-all --sequential format:staged lint:staged"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-easy-ui5.git"},"keywords":["yeoman-generator","sap","sapui5","openui5","sapbtp","generator","scaffold"],"author":"SAP","license":"Apache-2.0","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-easy-ui5/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-easy-ui5#readme","dependencies":{"@octokit/plugin-throttling":"^11.0.1","@octokit/rest":"^22.0.0","adm-zip":"^0.5.16","chalk":"^5.4.1","colors":"^1.4.0","glob":"^11.0.3","libnpmconfig":"^1.2.1","node-fetch":"^3.3.2","rimraf":"^5.0.5","yeoman-environment":"^4.4.3","yeoman-generator":"^7.5.1","yosay":"^2.0.2"},"devDependencies":{"@commitlint/cli":"^18.4.3","@commitlint/config-conventional":"^18.4.3","conventional-changelog-cli":"^4.1.0","cz-conventional-changelog":"^3.3.0","eslint":"^8.54.0","fs-extra":"^11.3.0","husky":"^8.0.3","lint-staged":"^15.1.0","mocha":"^10.2.0","npm-run-all":"^4.1.5","prettier":"^2.8.8","pretty-quick":"^3.1.3","yeoman-assert":"^3.1.1","yeoman-test":"^10.1.1"},"config":{"commitizen":{"path":"cz-conventional-changelog"}},"commitlint":{"extends":["@commitlint/config-conventional"]},"tags":["SAP"],"gitHubOwner":"ui5-community","gitHubRepo":"generator-easy-ui5","licenseSource":"apache-2.0","forks":73,"stars":263,"addedToBoUI5":"2022-07-28T10:22:57.868Z","createdAt":"2019-02-04T10:16:16.598Z","updatedAt":"2025-10-15T07:58:13.681Z","vscodeInstalls":-1,"sourceType":"command","githublink":"https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-easy-ui5/tree/main/","readme":"# Easy UI5 Generator\n\n[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]\n[![Build Status][test-image]][test-url]\n[![Dependency Status][librariesio-image]][repo-url]\n[![License Status][license-image]][license-url]\n[![REUSE status][reuse-image]][reuse-url]\n\n## Description\n\nEasy UI5 (`easy-ui5`) 💙 is a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator which enables you to create simple [SAPUI5](https://ui5.sap.com)/[OpenUI5](https://sdk.openui5.org)-based web-apps and other UI5-related projects within seconds.\n\nThis generator has been created to simplify the creation of your UI5 prototypes. Now you can scaffold simple UI5 projects from the shell/terminal of your choice. The current best practices (such as [async](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/12/18/ui5ers-buzz-41-best-practices-for-async-loading-in-ui5/)) are already baked into our templates so you don't have to worry about the definition of the metadata files.\n\nThe purpose of the (preinstalled) `project generator` is to guide you on your first steps with [SAPUI5](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/) and [SAP BTP](https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html) deployments. Once you are familiar with those technologies, you might want to tweak the projects to adapt them for productive use-cases (such as continuous deployment pipelines and full i18n).\n\n> Note: This project was formerly located at the [SAP GitHub organization](https://github.com/SAP). Starting with easy-ui5 v3, all templates were outsourced to repositories in the [UI5 Community](https://github.com/ui5-community/). To highlight easy-ui5 is also a fully community driven project, the project was moved to the [UI5 Community](https://github.com/ui5-community/), too. Still SAP employees take care of managing incoming feature requests and bug reports.\n>\n> By default, it will download the repository [generator-ui5-project](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-project/) which contains the templates that were previously integrated in easy-ui5 < 3.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Get [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (:warning: **version 20 or higher**).\n\n## Download and Installation\n\n1. Install the generator:\n\n   ```sh\n   npm install -g yo generator-easy-ui5\n   ```\n\n2. Verify your installation to see if Yeoman has been installed correctly:\n   ```sh\n   yo\n   ```\n   Make sure you see the `easy-ui5` generator listed.\n\n## Bootstrapping a new UI5 project\n\n> Create your first UI5 App within a few seconds!\n\n1. Scaffold your UI5 project:\n\n   ```\n   yo easy-ui5 project\n   ```\n\n2. Answer the prompts to create your new project.\n\n3. Run it locally:\n   ```\n   cd <your project directory>\n   npm start # or \"yarn start\"\n   ```\n\n## Target platforms\n\nDuring the prompting phase, the project generator will ask on which target platform your app should run. Currently, the following options are available:\n\n- Static webserver\n- Application Router\n- Application Frontend Service\n- SAP HTML5 Application Repository\n- SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition\n- SAP NetWeaver\n\n> Have a look at the [project generator](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-project/) for more usage instruction and information about its available subgenerators.\n\n## More generators\n\nAnd this is just the start!\n\nWe made easy-ui5 extensible, so that the entire [UI5 Community](https://github.com/ui5-community/) can build additional plugins to scaffold any UI5-related development activity.\n\nBy default, this generator comes with the [project generator](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-project) but there are many others as well:\n\n- [[ui5-community/generator-ui5-ts-app]](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-ts-app)\n- [[ui5-community/generator-ui5-ts-app-fcl]](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-ts-app-fcl)\n- [[ui5-community/generator-ui5-app]](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-app)\n- [[ui5-community/generator-ui5-flp-plugin]](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-flp-plugin)\n- [[ui5-community/generator-ui5-library]](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-library)\n- [[ui5-community/generator-ui5-ts-library]](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-ts-library)\n- [[ui5-community/generator-ui5-wdi5]](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-wdi5)\n- [[ui5-community/generator-ui5-add-extension]](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-add-extension)\n- [[ui5-community/generator-ui5-library-webc]](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-library-webc)\n\nTo download and use any of the plugins above, run the following command:\n\n```sh\nyo easy-ui5 [project|ts-app|...] # this is the name of the repository without the \"generator-ui5-\" prefix\n```\n\n## Calling generators\n\nRun the following command to see all subgenerators of a given generator:\n\n```sh\nyo easy-ui5 [project|ts-app|...] --list\n```\n\nOnce you decided on the generator, run:\n\n```sh\nyo easy-ui5 [project|ts-app|...]\n```\n\n## Proxy settings\n\nIf you are running easy-ui5 behind a coporate proxy, just use the default proxy environment variables for Node.js to configure your corporate proxy:\n\n- `HTTP_PROXY`: Specify the value to use as the HTTP proxy for all connections, e.g., `HTTP_PROXY=\"http://proxy.mycompany.com:8080/\"`.\n- `HTTPS_PROXY`: Specify the value to use as the HTTPS proxy for all connections, e.g., `HTTPS_PROXY=\"http://proxy.mycompany.com:8080/\"`.\n- `NO_PROXY`: Define the hosts that should bypass the proxy, e.g., `NO_PROXY=\"localhost,.mycompany.com,192.168.6.254:80\"`.\n\nIn addition, easy-ui5 also supports proxy configuration from the `.npmrc` configuration:\n\n```text\nhttp-proxy=http://proxy.mycompany.com:8080/\nhttps-proxy=http://proxy.mycompany.com:8080/\nproxy=http://proxy.mycompany.com:8080/\nno-proxy=localhost,.mycompany.com,192.168.6.254:80\n```\n\nThis configuration is shared with npm itself since this proxy configuration is used to download the packages from npm.\n\nProxies can be passed as env variables or as npm config options. The highest precedence have the `GLOBAL_AGENT_*` env variables before the regular env variables followed by the npm configuration options, e.g.:\n\n1. env: `GLOBAL_AGENT_HTTP_PROXY`\n2. env: `HTTP_PROXY`\n3. npm: `http-proxy`\n4. npm: `proxy`\n\n## How to obtain support\n\nPlease use the GitHub bug tracking system to post questions, bug reports or to create pull requests.\n\n##

UI5 proxy middleware using routes\n\nMiddleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), enabling proxy support.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-middleware-route-proxy --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- debug: `boolean`\n  enable logging\n- root directory of the request uri: `object`\n  used to match and forward requests to your server. Needs to include the leading slash  character (`/`).\n  - target: `string`\n    hostname of your backend server\n  - replacePath: `string` optional. If the request path needs to be modified by taking out the root directory uri\n  - auth: `object`\n    authorization object with username and password ( pass `false` if authorization is not required )\n    - user: `string`\n    - pass: `string` \n    - client: `string` optional. If the client is not the default client on the SAP system\n    - header: `string` optional. Is used as value for the `Authorization` header if available. `user` and `pass` values are not used in this case.\n  - changeOrigin: `boolean` optional. If provided, the value will be added to the [options of the http-proxy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-proxy#options).\n  \nEach `boolean` or `string` field in a root path object can either represent the actual value or the name of a parameter in a .env file. \n\nExample:\n```yml\n      debug: true\n      /sap: \n        target: http(s)://host:port\n        replacePath: true\n        auth:\n          user: Username\n          pass: Password!\n          client: '100' \n```\n\nExample with target/user/pass in .env file:\n```yaml\n      debug: true\n      /sap: \n        target: PROXY_TARGET\n        auth:\n          user: PROXY_USERNAME\n          pass: PROXY_PASSWORD\n          client: PROXY_CLIENT\n```\n\nExample with target and dedicated `Authorization` header in .env file:\n```yaml\n      debug: true\n      /sap: \n        target: PROXY_TARGET\n        auth:\n          header: PROXY_AUTHORIZATION\n        changeOrigin: true\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-route-proxy\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n},\n\"ui5\": {\n  \"dependencies\": [\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-route-proxy\",\n    // ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> As the devDependencies are not recognized by the UI5 tooling, they need to be listed in the `ui5 > dependencies` array. In addition, once using the `ui5 > dependencies` array you need to list all UI5 tooling relevant dependencies.\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-route-proxy\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      debug: true\n      /routeRootPath: \n        target: PROXY_TARGET\n        auth:\n          user: PROXY_USERNAME\n          pass: PROXY_PASSWORD\n```\n\n3. Add a `.env` file with your target, username and password for the proxy:\n\n```yaml\nPROXY_TARGET=<http(s)://host:port>\nPROXY_USERNAME=<username>\nPROXY_PASSWORD=<password>\n```\n","jsdoc":{},"downloadsCurrentMonth":1309,"downloadsCurrentFortnight":610,"downloads365":15123,"downloadsFortnightGrowth":-12.73,"downloadsHistory":[{"yearMonth":"2025-01","downloads":674},{"yearMonth":"2025-02","downloads":1046},{"yearMonth":"2025-03","downloads":1194},{"yearMonth":"2025-04","downloads":1070},{"yearMonth":"2025-05","downloads":1542},{"yearMonth":"2025-06","downloads":1211},{"yearMonth":"2025-07","downloads":1211},{"yearMonth":"2025-08","downloads":1656},{"yearMonth":"2025-09","downloads":1476},{"yearMonth":"2025-10","downloads":1290},{"yearMonth":"2025-11","downloads":1624}],"npmlink":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-route-proxy","versions":[{"version":"created","date":"2020-02-18T08:35:38.264Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-route-proxy/v/created","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"1.0.0","date":"2020-02-18T08:35:38.354Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-route-proxy/v/1.0.0","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"modified","date":"2022-05-22T16:29:11.708Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-route-proxy/v/modified","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"1.0.1","date":"2020-02-18T08:59:53.963Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-route-proxy/v/1.0.1","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"1.0.2","date":"2020-04-16T05:02:27.515Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-route-proxy/v/1.0.2","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"1.0.3","date":"2020-04-21T04:18:18.486Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-route-proxy/v/1.0.3","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"1.0.4","date":"2020-04-24T19:26:06.755Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-route-proxy/v/1.0.4","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"1.0.6","date":"2020-06-02T18:30:54.523Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-route-proxy/v/1.0.6","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"1.0.7","date":"2020-06-09T12:44:19.376Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-route-proxy/v/1.0.7","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"1.0.8","date":"2020-10-01T04:22:59.787Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-route-proxy/v/1.0.8","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"1.0.9","date":"2020-12-09T12:50:58.059Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-route-proxy/v/1.0.9","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"},{"version":"1.0.10","date":"2022-01-07T12:32:26.469Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-route-proxy/v/1.0.10","changelog":"","sourceType":"middleware"}]},{"name":"ui5-task-cachebuster-indexing","version":"1.0.2","description":"UI5 Tooling Task that for indexing files to enable the cachebuster directly into the dist folder","main":"lib/cachebuster-indexer.js","directories":{"lib":"lib"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/lemaiwo/ui5-task-cachebuster-indexing.git"},"keywords":["ui5","tooling","task"],"author":"Wouter Lemaire","license":"MIT","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/lemaiwo/ui5-task-cachebuster-indexing/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/lemaiwo/ui5-task-cachebuster-indexing#readme","dependencies":{"@ui5/builder":"^2.8.2"},"type":"task","tags":["cache","cachebuster"],"gitHubOwner":"lemaiwo","gitHubRepo":"ui5-task-cachebuster-indexing","licenseSource":"mit","forks":0,"stars":1,"addedToBoUI5":"2022-07-31T19:37:57.868Z","createdAt":"2021-04-13T21:51:25.631Z","updatedAt":"2022-05-22T16:30:00.663Z","vscodeInstalls":-1,"sourceType":"task","githublink":"https://github.com/lemaiwo/ui5-task-cachebuster-indexing/tree/main/","readme":"# UI5 task for indexing cachebuster files\n UI5 Tooling Task that for indexing files to enable the cachebuster directly into the dist folder\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-task-cachebuster-indexing --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- debug: `true|false`  \n  verbose logging\n\n## Usage\n\n1.

This will generate the resources with a path that can be found by the cachebuster. \n\nFor example a file with name \"Component-dbg.js\" will be cloned to  \"~1618522173771~/Component-dbg.js\", or another example \"model/models.js\" will be cloned to \"~1618522173782~/model/models.js\".\n\nIt is not needed to run the \"generateCachebusterInfo\" task as this already done inside this one. Nevertheless, this task should always be executed after the cachebuster info generation \"generateCachebusterInfo\".\n\n## Known limitations\n\nThe task \"generateCachebusterInfo\" can be configured to use timestamp or hash. This task only supports timestamp as it's currently not possible to acces the global config inside a custom task.","jsdoc":{},"downloadsCurrentMonth":515,"downloadsCurrentFortnight":236,"downloads365":10805,"downloadsFortnightGrowth":-15.41,"downloadsHistory":[{"yearMonth":"2025-01","downloads":1033},{"yearMonth":"2025-02","downloads":761},{"yearMonth":"2025-03","downloads":579},{"yearMonth":"2025-04","downloads":821},{"yearMonth":"2025-05","downloads":1266},{"yearMonth":"2025-06","downloads":1727},{"yearMonth":"2025-07","downloads":1231},{"yearMonth":"2025-08","downloads":833},{"yearMonth":"2025-09","downloads":867},{"yearMonth":"2025-10","downloads":714},{"yearMonth":"2025-11","downloads":399}],"npmlink":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-cachebuster-indexing","versions":[{"version":"created","date":"2021-04-13T21:51:25.631Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-cachebuster-indexing/v/created","changelog":"","sourceType":"task"},{"version":"1.0.0","date":"2021-04-13T21:51:25.744Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-cachebuster-indexing/v/1.0.0","changelog":"","sourceType":"task"},{"version":"modified","date":"2022-05-22T16:30:00.663Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-cachebuster-indexing/v/modified","changelog":"","sourceType":"task"},{"version":"1.0.2","date":"2021-04-19T20:46:09.932Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-cachebuster-indexing/v/1.0.2","changelog":"","sourceType":"task"}]},{"name":"ui5-task-transpile-gen","version":"1.0.4","description":"UI5tooling transpile code from ES6 to ES5 including Async Await syntax","main":"index.js","scripts":{"test":"echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"},"author":"Wouter Lemaire","license":"MIT","repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/lemaiwo/ui5-task-transpile-gen.git"},"dependencies":{"@babel/core":"^7.9.0","@babel/plugin-transform-modules-commonjs":"^7.9.0","@babel/preset-env":"^7.9.0","@ui5/fs":"^1.1.2","colors":"^1.4.0","node-emoji":"^1.10.0","regenerator-runtime":"^0.13.3"},"type":"task","tags":["transpiler","regenerator-runtime"],"gitHubOwner":"lemaiwo","gitHubRepo":"ui5-task-transpile-gen","licenseSource":"mit","forks":1,"stars":1,"addedToBoUI5":"2022-07-31T19:37:57.868Z","createdAt":"2020-02-20T11:30:07.000Z","updatedAt":"2022-05-22T16:30:35.696Z","vscodeInstalls":-1,"sourceType":"task","githublink":"https://github.com/lemaiwo/ui5-task-transpile-gen/tree/master/","readme":"# ui5-task-transpile-gen\nUI5tooling task for transpiling ES6 to ES5 including Async Await\n\nTask for [ui5-builder](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-builder), enabling ES6 support.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-task-transpile-gen --save-dev\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n1.

For more information, see [Enablement of semantic highlighting](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/semantic-highlight-guide#enablement-of-semantic-highlighting)\n\n### XML View Format\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAP/ui5-language-assistant/master/packages/vscode-ui5-language-assistant/resources/readme/preview-formatter.gif)\n\n#### Description\n\nThe tool can format `*.view.xml` and `*.fragment.xml` files with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier)\n\n#### Relevant User/Workspace settings\n\n- `UI5LanguageAssistant.SplitAttributesOnFormat` is set on by default and places each attribute on a new line on formatting.\n\n### manifest.json Auto-Complete and Validations\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAP/ui5-language-assistant/master/packages/vscode-ui5-language-assistant/resources/readme/preview-manifest-json.gif)\n\n#### Description:\n\nImplemented using the UI5 [manifest.json schema](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-manifest/blob/master/schema.json).\n\n## Installation\n\n### From the VS Code Marketplace\n\nIn the [UI5 Language Assistant](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SAPOSS.vscode-ui5-language-assistant) VS Code marketplace page, click **Install**.\n\n### From GitHub Releases\n\n1. Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sap/ui5-language-assistant/releases).\n2. Search for the `.vsix` archive under `ui5-language-assist\\@x.y.z` releases. (Replace `x.y.z` with the desired version number.)\n3. Follow the instructions for installing an extension from a `.vsix` file in the [VSCode's guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_install-from-a-vsix).\n\n### Usage\n\nThis extension's features are automatically enabled when opening/editing relevant SAPUI5 source files.\nFor SAPUI5 XML views, this means:`*.view.xml` or `*.fragment.xml` files.\n\nNote that the extension **lazily** downloads the SAPUI5 metadata needed for its features.\nThis means that there may be a delay between starting VS Code and having the relevant features available.\n\nWhen working with CAP projects, make sure you have @sap/cds module installed. For this, run npm install on your project. This command will download and install all necessary modules from the npm package repository.\n\n### Enabling offline work\n\nYou can set up a local web server to host one or more supported versions of SAPUI5 SDK and register it in the user/workspace setting `\"UI5LanguageAssistant.SAPUI5WebServer\"`. This overrides the public CDN of SAPUI5 SDK in the extension and enables offline work with the apps having the matching hosted `\"minUI5Version\"` in `manifest.json`.\nWhen configuring local web server, make sure it responds to the exact UI5 version defined in manifest.json e.g `<your.local.web.server>/1.111.0`\n\n**Note**: Once online, UI5 Language Assistant also caches required resources for offline usage and performance optimization.\n\n### Limitations\n\n#### UI5 version and framework\n\nThis extension derives the UI5 version in the following sequence:\n\n1. If the exact version defined in the `minUI5Version` setting is not retrievable from local cache or CDN, the closest available LTS version is used.\n2. If the version is 1.38 or older, or if minUI5Version is not defined, fall back to 1.71 (latest patch level) is applied.\n3. If `minUI5Version` is provided in incorrect format, the latest patch version available in CDN is used.\n\nThe framework(SAPUI5/OpenUI5) is derived from the ui5.yaml file. This defaults to SAPUI5.\n\n#### Custom controls\n\nThis extension does not currently support custom controls, some features, such as validations,\nmay use heuristics to guess that a tag is a custom control. However, no auto-complete is currently offered\nfor custom controls.\n\n### Support\n\nYou can open [issues](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-language-assistant/issues) on GitHub.\n\n### Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Licensing\n\nCopyright 2022 SAP SE.

[UI5 Parser configuration](https://github.com/iljapostnovs/ui5plugin-parser/blob/master/README.md#config-default-values). Contains parser related configuration, e.g. UI5 Version, URL for standard library metadata preload, exclude folder patterns etc. Configuration can be done in `package.json` or any of `rc` file types, e.g. `.ui5pluginrc`.\r\n\r\n> **Important!** If `ui5parser` related entries were changed in the `package.json` or any other `rc` file, VSCode should be reloaded manually\r\n\r\n2. [UI5 Linter configuration](https://github.com/iljapostnovs/ui5plugin-linter/blob/master/README.md#configuration-example).

(E.g. \"/src/control/Text.js\" => \"anycomponentname.control.Text\")\r\n-   You have an access to https://ui5.sap.com for standard lib metadata preload\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Proxy\r\n\r\nIf HTTP_PROXY or HTTPS_PROXY environment variables are set, https://ui5.sap.com will be requested using the proxy.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Known issues\r\n\r\n## acorn-loose\r\n\r\nacorn-loose is used as JS parser. It has issues if you have mixed spaces and tabs.\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction() {\r\n\t var oModel = this.getModel();\r\n\tvar asd;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is an unnecessary space before `var oModel` and acorn is parsing it incorrectly.\r\nAs a result - the file will not be parsed as expected and you might not get JS completion items and get errors in xml views regarding wrong values for event handlers.<br/>\r\nKeep your code clean, it will help you to have the plugin working correctly :)<br/>\r\nIt's highly recommended to set formatting on save in your VS Code preferences, it will help to avoid such issues.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"editor.formatOnSave\": true\r\n```\r\n\r\nStandard VSCode JS Formatter is not handling all formatting issues. `hookyqr.beautify` extension did, but it got deprecated. It's highly recommended to install some kind of formatter, e.g. Prettier, and use as JS formatter.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"[javascript]\": {\r\n\t\"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"<YourFormatter>\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## ui5.sap.com damaged JSON response\r\n\r\nFor some reason `ui5.sap.com` sometimes might return damaged JSON when requesting standard library metadata. As a result, it is possible to get such error as:<br/>\r\n![UIFiveError](/images/UIFiveError.png)<br/>\r\nTo solve it, please run `UI5: Clear cache` command and reload VSCode.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Things to consider using TS\r\n\r\n1. If any `.ts` files are found and `tsconfig.json` is found, project is considered to be TS project\r\n2. `src-gen` folder is automatically excluded by extension if it's TS project. If build folder has different name, it should be added to folder exclusions in [UI5 Parser configuration](https://github.com/iljapostnovs/ui5plugin-parser/blob/master/README.md#config-default-values).\r\n3. Folder with builded resources should be added to exclusions of `ui5parser`. Check `excludeFolderPatterns` in package.json.\r\n4. Not all linters work for TS, because TS has a lot out of the box features. E.g. Wrong field/method linter works only for JS, because TS has it's own syntax analysis for that.\r\n5. `ts-morph` is used as TS parser and it has some drawbacks. When using typechecker to get type e.g. of the field or return type of the method, `ts-morph` might hang up for about ~10s, which is not great. However, types are crucial for Reference CodeLens/Linters, specifically for fields in order to be able to distinguish them in views/fragments. As a workaround for performance issues, typechecker is not used to get field types. Because of that only simple structure is allowed.\r\n\r\nExamples which should work as expected:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport default class Random {\r\n  formatterInstance = new Formatter(),\r\n  formatterObject = Formatter\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the same time type detection will work if the type is specifically written, e.g.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nformatter: Formatter = ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Disabling TS standard reference code lens should be considered. This extension contains its own reference code lens, which includes references to views and fragments.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Extension recommendations\r\n\r\n-

Add `@ui5ignore` to method declaration JSDoc\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n/**\r\n * @ui5ignore\r\n */\r\n_myMethod(sFirstParam, iSecondParam) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Add method to `jsLinterExceptions` in `package.json`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"ui5\": {\r\n\t\t\"ui5linter\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"jsLinterExceptions\": [\r\n\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"className\": \"com.test.MyClass\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"memberName\": \"_myMethod\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"applyToChildren\": true\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t]\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### View and fragment errors\r\n\r\nTo ignore attribute and tag errors, `<-- @ui5ignore -->` can be used. It will ignore all errors of next tag and its attributes.\r\n\r\n```XML\r\n<!-- @ui5ignore -->\r\n<RandomText\r\n\trandomProperty=\"123\"\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo ignore specific attribute, `<-- @ui5ignore ${attributeName1}, ${attributeName2} -->` can be used. It will ignore all attribute errors\r\n\r\n```XML\r\n<!-- @ui5ignore randomProperty, secondRandomProperty -->\r\n<Text\r\n\trandomProperty=\"123\"\r\n\tsecondRandomProperty=\"123\"\r\n\ttext=\"Valid property\"\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo ignore all id and event handler pattern errors of the next tag, `<-- @ui5ignore-patterns -->` can be used.\r\n\r\n```XML\r\n<!-- @ui5ignore-patterns -->\r\n<Text\r\n\tid=\"myRandomId\"\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo ignore specific id or event handler pattern errors of the next tag, `<-- @ui5ignore-patterns ${attributeName1}, ${attributeName2} -->` can be used.\r\n\r\n```XML\r\n<!-- @ui5ignore-patterns id -->\r\n<Button\r\n\tid=\"myRandomId\"\r\n\tpress=\"myRandomHandler\"\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### i18n errors\r\n\r\nTo ignore translation errors, `# @ui5ignore` comment right above the translation can be used\r\n\r\n```properties\r\n# @ui5ignore\r\nMY_TITLE = Title\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other ways\r\n\r\n#### Exclude whole class\r\n\r\nTo exclude whole class from linting, add class name to `package.json`. In case of JS Classes, use `jsClassExceptions`. In case of view and fragments, use `xmlClassExceptions`\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"ui5\": {\r\n\t\t\"ui5linter\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"jsClassExceptions\": [\"com.test.MyClass\"]\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Exclude i18n translations\r\n\r\nTo exclude translation from linting in `18n.properties` file, add class name to `package.json`\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"ui5\": {\r\n\t\t\"ui5linter\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"propertiesLinterExceptions\": [\"MY_TRANSLATION_ID\"]\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Exclude other apps or libs\r\n\r\nLets assume that there is a library included in the project, and there is no need to lint it.\r\nTo exclude whole app or lib from linting, add app/lib id to `package.json`. There are two preference entries that can be used: `componentsToInclude` and `componentsToExclude`.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"ui5\": {\r\n\t\t\"ui5linter\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"componentsToInclude\": [\"com.test.my.app\"],\r\n\t\t\t\"componentsToExclude\": [\"com.test.my.lib\"]\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## ID and Event Handler patterns in views and fragments\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the same style for naming the `id` and any `event handler` in views and fragments, three configuration entries are available: `idNamingPattern`, `eventNamingPattern`, `attributesToCheck`. Every `id` and `event handler` generates individual `RegExp`, and the value is checked against it.\r\n\r\n> **Hint!** To disable naming style checking, just set `idNamingPattern` or/and `eventNamingPattern` as empty string in `package.json`\r\n\r\n### Variables\r\n\r\nIn order to generate individual `RegExp`, there are variables available which will be applied at runtime. All variables are available in `camelCase` and `PascalCase`.\r\n\r\nExample of `eventNamingPattern`: `^on{MeaningAssumption}{ControlName}.*?{EventName}$`.\r\nVariables: `MeaningAssumption`, `ControlName`, `EventName`.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Input\r\n\tvalue=\"{ODataModel>Currency}\"\r\n\tchange=\"\"\r\n>\r\n<!-- Pattern for 'change': ^onCurrencyInput.*?Change$ -->\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### ControlName variable\r\n\r\nVariable is replaced with the name of the tag. Available for both `id` and `event handler` patterns.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Text/>\r\n<!-- ControlName => Text -->\r\n<!-- controlName => text -->\r\n<f:GridList/>\r\n<!-- ControlName => GridList -->\r\n<!-- controlName => gridList -->\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### EventName variable\r\n\r\nVariable is replaced with the name of the event. Available for `event handler` patterns only.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Button press=\"onButtonPress\"/>\r\n<!-- EventName => Press -->\r\n<!-- eventName => press -->\r\n<f:GridList borderReached=\"onGridListBorderReached\"/>\r\n<!-- EventName => BorderReached -->\r\n<!-- eventName => borderReached -->\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### MeaningAssumption variable\r\n\r\nVariable is replaced with guessed value taken from attribute. Available for both `id` and `event handler` patterns. This is the most tricky variable.\r\n\r\nIt is calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Get value of `attributesToCheck` configuration\r\n2. Find first attribute from the control which exists in `attributesToCheck` array.\r\n3. Parse attribute value\r\n    1. If attribute value is a binding, use binding text as a source for `MeaningAssumption`\r\n        1. Find binding path. If binding path is an object, parse it and take the text from `path` field, otherwise crop `{` and `}`\r\n        2. Split string by `>`, left part is model name, right part is `binding path`\r\n            1. If model name is `i18n`, find the translation in `i18n.properties`, transform value to PascalCase and return the value\r\n            2. Else, remove `/results` from `binding path`, split the result by `_`, transform to PascalCase and return the value\r\n    2. If attribute value is not a binding, transform the value to PascalCase and return it\r\n\r\n| Attribute value           | MeaningAssumption value                                |\r\n| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |\r\n| {/OrderItems}             | OrderItems                                             |\r\n| {OrderId}                 | OrderId                                                |\r\n| {/OrderItems/results}     | OrderItems                                             |\r\n| {ODataModel>/ORDER_ITEMS} | OrderItems                                             |\r\n| {MyModel>/Orders}         | Orders                                                 |\r\n| {i18n>APP_TITLE}          | OrderApp (if text in `i18n.properties` is \"Order App\") |\r\n\r\n> **Hint!** > `MeaningAssumption` is pure heuristics and of course will not work for all the cases. If it works most of the time well, but there are some exceptions, it is possible to ignore specific tag attribute errors. Check [View and fragment errors](#view-and-fragment-errors) section.\r\n\r\nExample.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<List\r\n\tid=\"idOrderItemsList\"\r\n\titems=\"{ODataModel>/OrderItems}\"\r\n\tpress=\"onOrderItemsListPress\"\r\n/>\r\n<!--\r\n\tControlName =>

configuration\r\n\r\nThis configuration is a list of attributes, where `MeaningAssumption` will be guessed from.\r\nFor instance, if `attributesToCheck` is set to `\"attributesToCheck\": [\"items\"]`, the value will be guessed only from `items` attribute, e.g. in `sap.m.List`:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<List\r\n\tid=\"idOrdersList\"\r\n\titems=\"{/Orders}\"\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## XML Formatter\r\n\r\nIt is possible to format fragments and views using CMD.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nui5linter --format\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Path pattern\r\n\r\nIt is possible to set the path pattern of the files which should be formatted.\r\nDefault value: ­`**/*.{fragment,view}.xml`\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nui5linter --format --path=**/*.{fragment,view}.xml\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Closing tag on newline\r\n\r\nIt is possible to pass a parameter if closing tags (\">\", \"/>\") should be located on newline\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nui5linter --format --tagEndNewline\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Add space before a self-closing

Configuration\r\n\r\n### RC and package.json\r\n\r\nConfiguration can be done in `package.json` or in any of `rc` file types:\r\n - `.ui5pluginrc`\r\n - `.ui5pluginrc.json`\r\n - `.ui5pluginrc.yaml`\r\n - `.ui5pluginrc.yml`\r\n - `.ui5pluginrc.js`\r\n\r\n For simplicity purposes all examples are written for `package.json`, but it works the same way for all file types.\r\n\r\n### Config interface\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface IUI5PackageConfigEntry {\r\n\tui5?: IUI5ParserEntry;\r\n}\r\ninterface IUI5ParserEntry {\r\n\tui5parser?: IUI5ParserEntryFields;\r\n}\r\ninterface IUI5ParserEntryFields {\r\n\tui5version?: string;\r\n\texcludeFolderPatterns?: string[];\r\n\tdataSource?: string;\r\n\trejectUnauthorized?: boolean;\r\n\tlibsToLoad?: string[];\r\n\tadditionalWorkspaces?: string[];\r\n\tnodeProjects?: string[];\r\n\tproxyWorkspaces?: string[];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Config default values\r\n\r\nDefault `package.json` or `rc` file config looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n{\r\n\t\"ui5\": {\r\n\t\t\"ui5parser\": {\r\n\t\t\t// UI5 Version for standard library metadata preload from ui5.sap.com.

Otherwise it's JS project.\r\n\r\n> **Important!** Take in mind that nested projects are not supported anymore, which means that there can be no folders with such structure:\r\n\r\n```\r\n├── webapp\r\n│   ├── library\r\n│   │   ├── library.js\r\n│   │   └── manifest.json\r\n│   ├── Component.js\r\n│   └── manifest.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n> The structure which will work as expected:\r\n\r\n```\r\n├── library\r\n│   ├── library.js\r\n│   └── manifest.json\r\n├── webapp\r\n│   ├── Component.js\r\n│   └── manifest.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Additional Workspaces\r\n\r\nIf there is a e.g. library outside of the `CWD`, checkout `additionalWorkspaces` config for `ui5parser`.\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\n├── MyApp (CWD)\r\n│   │   ├── webapp\r\n│   │   │   ├── manifest.json\r\n│   │   │   └── Component.js\r\n│   └── package.json\r\n├── MyLibrary (Outside of CWD)\r\n│   │   ├── src\r\n│   │   │   ├── manifest.json\r\n│   │   │   └── library.js\r\n│   └── package.json\r\n└── tsconfig.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo make this work, corresponding entry in `package.json` should be added\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"ui5\": {\r\n   \"ui5parser\": {\r\n      \"additionalWorkspaces\" : [\"../MyLibrary\"]\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Proxy Workspaces\r\n\r\nThere are cases when project is mixed, meaning that one folder may contain many different projects inside, non-ui5 as well. Most frequent case would be CAP project with both backend and frontend in one folder.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\n├── frontend\r\n│   ├── webapp\r\n│   │   └── manifest.json\r\n│   ├── package.json (<- this file will be used as configuration source after proxyWorkspaces is configured)\r\n│   └── tsconfig.json\r\n├── backend\r\n│   ├── Whatever.js\r\n│   └── package.json\r\n├── package.json (<- proxyWorkspaces should be configured here)\r\n└── tsconfig.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo make the parser work only for `frontend` folder, corresponding entry in `package.json` should be added\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"ui5\": {\r\n   \"ui5parser\": {\r\n      \"proxyWorkspaces\" : [\"./frontend\"]\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat happens is that `CWD` is replaced with the new path from `proxyWorkspaces`, so at instantiation stage `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` from `frontend` folder will be used instead of root folder.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Node projects\r\n\r\nThere are cases when custom projects (e.g. libraries) installed via `npm` are used, for that purpose `nodeProjects` configuration entry was created.\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n`npm install my-custom-library`\r\n\r\n`package.json`:\r\n```json\r\n\"ui5\": {\r\n   \"ui5parser\": {\r\n\t\t\"nodeProjects\": [\"my-custom-library\"]\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n> **Important!** In order to get the project parsed properly, it should have `-dbg.js` files and `manifest.json`. Configuration will be inherited from main project (project in `CWD`). In other words, npm packages which were not built properly and have no `manifest.json` will not work.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## TS vs JS\r\n\r\n### Initialization\r\n\r\nIf `tsconfig.json` is found in the CWD and any `.ts` files are found in the workspace, parser considers that it's TS project. <br/>\r\n`tsconfig.json` should be located in CWD.\r\n\r\n### Folder exclusions\r\n\r\nFor convenience purposes `UI5TSParser` ignores `src-gen` folder, because they contain transpiled JS/XML files, which can make the parser to think that source files are there. If build folder name is different, is should be added to `excludeFolderPatterns` in your `package.json`. If you are using older tooling with manual babel transpiler which generates `webapp` folder, it should be added to `excludeFolderPatterns` as well\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\nInitialization process reads the metadata of standard SAPUI5 classes and parses all projects in CWD (Current working directory), it's encapsulated into `createInstances` method. For getting parsers just call it.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst wsFolders = [new WorkspaceFolder(\"Absolute path to the workspace\")];\r\nconst parsers = await ParserFactory.createInstances(wsFolders);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNecessary methods for getting information about the classes exists `ParserPool` class, which works with all parser instances. As an example, to get the parser for custom class, `getParserForCustomClass` can be used:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst parser = ParserPool.getParserForCustomClass(\"com.test.any.class\");\r\nconst UIClass = parser.classFactory.getUIClass(\"com.test.any.class\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nUIClass will have class metadata such as fields, methods, properties, aggregations, associations, events etc.\r\n\r\n> _TS only!_ For performance reasons TS parser doesn't parse types right away. If you want to load all type info such as method return type, parameter types etc, please use

It might be also narrowed to searched string, for\n  example \"get...\" methods - ?mget etc.\n\n### Favorites\n\nThey can be used to have frequently used objects always available.

It can also be a URL to metadata,\nfor example, <https://services.odata.org/V3/OData/OData.svc/$metadata>. The path for mock data\nfiles is set via `mockDataTargetDirectory`.\n\nFor the [Northwind test service](https://services.odata.org/V3/OData/OData.svc/$metadata):\n![mock files](https://publicrepo.vipserv.org/images/vscode-mock/mock-files.png)\n\nBy default each file has 30 entries (this is adjustable by the setting `defaultLengthOfEntitySets`)\nand new files will overwrite old ones (change this with `overwriteExistingMockFiles`).\nThe length of data set can be also adjusted per entity set by using\nusing .rules.json file (explained later).\n\nThe default root URI is an empty string, it can be changed by setting `mockDataRootURI`: \"myURI\".\n\n## Configure mock data generation\n\nAdditional options influencing data generation can be specified in _.rules.json_ file.\nThis file is by default searched in the project root, but it can be changed using setting\n`mockRulesConfigFilePath`. The JSON provided in this file corresponds to the\n[_rules_ property](https://wozjac.github.io/omg-odata-mock-generator/ODataMockGenerator.html).\n\nBelow examples are based on the metadata from <https://sapes5.sapdevcenter.com/sap/opu/odata/sap/ZSOCDS_SRV>\n\n### Skipping mock data generation for entity sets\n\nIf you don't want to generate files for given entity sets, because we prefer to have our\nown ones, then by using _\"skipMockGeneration\"_: [_EntitySetName1_,_EntitySetName2_]\nmock data generation will be skipped for them.\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"skipMockGeneration\": [\"SEPM_I_SalesOrderItem_E\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Setting number of generated entities\n\n_defaultLengthOfEntitySets_ settings sets the default number of generated entries;\nthis can be overwritten for a specific entity sets using _rules.lengthOf_ option.\n\nSetting generation of 2 entries for Products, 12 for Categories:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  lengthOf: {\n    Products: 2,\n    Categories: 12\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Using faker.js\n\nFaker.js [API methods](https://marak.github.io/faker.js/#toc5__anchor) can be provided\nand they will be used instead of default logic for data generation.\nAlternatively, Mustache-like string with several values can be also passed as described\nin the faker.js docs, for example `{{person.lastName}}, {{person.firstName}} {{person.suffix}}`.\nIf the string property has \\*MaxLength\" attribute, generated value will be limited accordingly.\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"faker\": {\n    \"Entity\": {\n      \"Property1\": \"faker.method\",\n      \"Property2\": \"{{faker.method}}, {{faker.method}}\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"faker\": {\n    \"Product\": {\n      \"Name\": \"commerce.productName\",\n      \"Description\": \"{{lorem.paragraph}}, {{commerce.productDescription}}\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Predefined values\n\nIf for some entities values should be randomly selected BUT from predefined set of values,\nthen it can be configured in the following way:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"predefined\": {\n    \"Entity\": {\n      \"Property\": [Value1, Value2, Value3]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"predefined\": {\n    \"SEPM_I_SalesOrder_EType\": {\n      \"ID\": [\"myID1\", \"myID2\", \"myID3\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Predefined values based on other values\n\nFor some values it make sense to make them dependent on other values. This can be achieved in the following way:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"predefined\": {\n    \"Entity\": {\n      \"Property1\": [Value1, Value2, Value2],\n      \"Property2\": {\n        \"reference\": \"Property1\",\n        \"values\": [{\n          \"key\": Value1,\n          \"value\": \"Description for value 1\"\n        },{\n          \"key\": Value2,\n          \"value\": \"Description for value 2\"\n        }]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNot all dependent values have to be provided; if a value is not found in the _values_ array,\nit will be generated as usual.\n\nFor example we want to have valid set of IDs in\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"predefined\": {\n    \"SEPM_I_SalesOrder_EType\": {\n      \"ID\": [\"myID1\", \"myID2\", \"myID3\"],\n      \"SalesOrder_Text\": {\n        \"reference\": \"ID\",\n        \"values\": [{\n          \"key\": \"myID1\",\n          \"value\": \"Custom text for myID1\"\n         }, {\n           \"key\": \"myID2\",\n           \"value\": \"Another custom text for myID2\"\n        }]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Re-using predefined values\n\nIt is easier to keep predefined values in one place, as they might be used in several places.\nIt can be done with help of special _variables_ property and special $ref:... handling:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"myValues\": [value1, value2, value3]\n  },\n  \"predefined\": {\n    \"Entity\": {\n      \"Property1\": \"$ref:myValues\",\n      \"Property2\": {\n        \"reference\": \"Property1\",\n        \"values\": [{\n          \"key\": \"value1\",\n          \"value\": \"Text1\"\n        }, {\n          \"key\": \"value2\",\n          \"value\": \"Text2\"\n        }]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"salesOrderIDs\": [\"myID1\", \"myID2\", \"myID3\"]\n  },\n  \"predefined\": {\n    \"SEPM_I_SalesOrder_EType\": {\n      \"ID\": \"$ref:salesOrderIDs\",\n      \"Name\": {\n        \"reference\": \"ID\",\n        \"values\": [{\n          \"key\": \"myID1\",\n          \"value\": \"Custom text for myID1\"\n        }, {\n          \"key\": \"myID2\",\n          \"value\": \"Another custom text for myID2\"\n        }]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Distinct values\n\nHaving predefined values for entities and their key properties, duplicated entries will be present,\nas the generator always produces the number of entries specified by the\n`defaultLengthOfEntitySets` or `lengthOf: {...`\nproperty from .rules.json. To have only distinct values (based on all key properties):\n\n```javascript\n{\n    \"variables\": [...]\n    \"distinctValues\": [\"EnitytSet1\", \"EntitySet2\"]\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n### Sample .rules.json file\n\nSample .rules.json file with all features, based on <https://services.odata.org/V3/Northwind/Northwind.svc/$metadata>\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"skipMockGeneration\": [\"Summary_of_Sales_by_Quarters\", \"Summary_of_Sales_by_Years\"],\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"categoryIDs\": [1, 2, 3]\n  },\n  \"distinctValues\": [\"Categories\"],\n  \"faker\": {\n    \"Employee\": {\n      \"City\": \"address.city\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"lengthOf\": {\n    \"Order_Details_Extendeds\": 10\n  },\n  \"predefined\": {\n    \"Category\": {\n      \"CategoryID\": \"$ref:categoryIDs\",\n      \"CategoryName\": {\n        \"reference\": \"CategoryID\",\n        \"values\": [{\n          \"key\": 1,\n          \"value\": \"Custom text for ID 1\"\n        }, {\n          \"key\": 2,\n          \"value\": \"Another custom text for ID 2\"\n        }]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Extension Settings\n\nThis extension contributes the following settings:\n\n- `metadataPath`: the path to the OData service - URL or file path (relative to the project root).\n  Default is webapp/localService/metadata.xml\n- `mockDataRootURI`: the root URI for mock data entries. Default is \"\".\n- `mockDataTargetDirectory`: the target directory for generated mock data files.\n  Default is webapp/localService/mockdata\n- `defaultLengthOfEntitySets`: default length of data set for each entity set.\n  Default value is 30. It can be overridden in .rules.json\n- `overwriteExistingMockFiles`: overwrite existing files in the mock data target directory?\n  Default is true.\n- `mockRulesConfigFilePath`: where .rules.json file should be searched for\n\n## Release Notes\n\nSee CHANGELOG.md\n\n## License\n\nThis plugin is licensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\n## Author\n\nFeel free to contact me:\n\n- <wozjac@zoho.com>\n- [jacekw.dev](https://jacekw.dev)\n- Bluesky (<https://jacekwoz.bsky.social>)\n- LinkedIn (<https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacek-wznk>)\n\nIcon based on a one from <https://www.freepik.com> / <https://www.flaticon.com/>\n","downloadsCurrentMonth":-1,"downloadsCurrentFortnight":-1,"downloads365":-1,"vscodelink":"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jacek-wozniczak.vscode-ui5-odata-mock-generator","versions":[{"version":"1.1.7","date":"2025-10-06T11:17:34.517Z","link":"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/jacek-wozniczak.vscode-ui5-odata-mock-generator/changelog","changelog":"","sourceType":"vscode"},{"version":"1.1.6","date":"2025-06-12T09:52:24.513Z","link":"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/jacek-wozniczak.vscode-ui5-odata-mock-generator/changelog","changelog":"","sourceType":"vscode"},{"version":"1.1.5","date":"2025-01-07T08:40:27.663Z","link":"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/jacek-wozniczak.vscode-ui5-odata-mock-generator/changelog","changelog":"","sourceType":"vscode"},{"version":"1.1.4","date":"2024-11-17T20:14:19.757Z","link":"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/jacek-wozniczak.vscode-ui5-odata-mock-generator/changelog","changelog":"","sourceType":"vscode"},{"version":"1.1.2","date":"2024-06-23T13:45:59.833Z","link":"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/jacek-wozniczak.vscode-ui5-odata-mock-generator/changelog","changelog":"","sourceType":"vscode"},{"version":"1.1.1","date":"2022-08-21T12:27:25.397Z","link":"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/jacek-wozniczak.vscode-ui5-odata-mock-generator/changelog","changelog":"","sourceType":"vscode"},{"version":"1.1.0","date":"2022-04-21T19:37:05.913Z","link":"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/jacek-wozniczak.vscode-ui5-odata-mock-generator/changelog","changelog":"","sourceType":"vscode"},{"version":"1.0.0","date":"2021-05-29T17:55:11.03Z","link":"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/jacek-wozniczak.vscode-ui5-odata-mock-generator/changelog","changelog":"","sourceType":"vscode"}],"changelog":"# Changelog\n\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

self-sufficient test runner for UI5 applications enabling parallel execution of tests.\n\n> To put it in a nutshell, some UI5 applications have so many tests that when you run them in a browser, it ends up **crashing**. The main reason is **memory consumption** : the browser process goes up to 2 GB and it blows up. JavaScript is based on garbage collecting but it needs time to operate and the stress caused by executing the tests as well as the use of iframes do not let enough bandwidth for the browser to free up the memory.\n\n> This tool is designed and built as a **substitute** of the [UI5 karma runner](https://github.com/SAP/karma-ui5). It executes all the tests in **parallel** thanks to several browser instances *(which also **reduces the total execution time**)*.\n\n## 📚 [Documentation](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/ui5-test-runner/)\n\n## 💿 How to install\n\n* Works with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) >= 24\n* Local installation\n  * `npm install --save-dev ui5-test-runner`\n  * Trigger either with `npx ui5-test-runner` or through an npm script invoking `ui5-test-runner`\n* Global installation\n  * `npm install --global ui5-test-runner`\n  * Trigger with `ui5-test-runner`\n\n**NOTE** : additional packages might be needed during the execution (`puppeteer`, `selenium-webdriver`, `nyc`...) . If they are found installed **locally** in the tested project, they are used. Otherwise, they are installed **globally**.\n\n## ⚖️ License\n[![FOSSA

Configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n    The configuration for the custom middleware:\n\n    ```yaml\n    server:\n      customMiddleware:\n      - name: \"@ui5/middleware-code-coverage\"\n        afterMiddleware: compression\n        configuration:\n          report:\n            reporter: [\"html\"]\n            \"report-dir\": \"./tmp/coverage-reports\"\n            watermarks: {\n              statements: [50, 80],\n              functions: [50, 80],\n              branches: [50, 80],\n              lines: [50, 80]\n            }\n          instrument:\n            produceSourceMap: true\n            coverageGlobalScope: \"window.top\"\n            coverageGlobalScopeFunc: false\n          cwd: \"./\"\n          excludePatterns:\n          - \"lib/\"\n          - \"another/dir/in/webapp\"\n          - \"yet/another/dir\"\n    ```\n\n2. Change the qunit coverage module `qunit-coverage.js` to `qunit-coverage-istanbul.js` in your test html files\n\n    **Old:**\n\n    ```html title=\"unitTests.qunit.html\"\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\n    <html>\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n        <title>Unit tests for OpenUI5 App</title>\n\n        <script id=\"sap-ui-bootstrap\" src=\"../../resources/sap-ui-core.js\"\n          data-sap-ui-theme=\"sap_horizon\"\n          data-sap-ui-resourceroots='{\n            \"ui5.sample\": \"../../\"\n          }' data-sap-ui-language=\"EN\" data-sap-ui-async=\"true\">\n        </script>\n\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"../../resources/sap/ui/thirdparty/qunit-2.css\">\n\n        <script src=\"../../resources/sap/ui/thirdparty/qunit-2.js\"></script>\n        <script src=\"../../resources/sap/ui/qunit/qunit-junit.js\"></script>\n        <script src=\"../../resources/sap/ui/qunit/qunit-coverage.js\"\n          data-sap-ui-cover-only=\"ui5/sample/\"\n          data-sap-ui-cover-never=\"ui5/sample/test/\"></script>\n        <script src=\"../../resources/sap/ui/thirdparty/sinon.js\"></script>\n        <script src=\"../../resources/sap/ui/thirdparty/sinon-qunit.js\"></script>\n\n        <script src=\"unitTests.qunit.js\"></script>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <div id=\"qunit\"></div>\n        <div id=\"qunit-fixture\"></div>\n    </body>\n    </html>\n    ```\n\n    **New:**\n\n    ```diff html title=\"unitTests.qunit.html\"\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\n    <html>\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n        <title>Unit tests for OpenUI5 App</title>\n\n        <script id=\"sap-ui-bootstrap\" src=\"../../resources/sap-ui-core.js\"\n          data-sap-ui-theme=\"sap_horizon\"\n          data-sap-ui-resourceroots='{\n            \"ui5.sample\": \"../../\"\n          }' data-sap-ui-language=\"EN\" data-sap-ui-async=\"true\">\n        </script>\n\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"../../resources/sap/ui/thirdparty/qunit-2.css\">\n\n        <script src=\"../../resources/sap/ui/thirdparty/qunit-2.js\"></script>\n        <script src=\"../../resources/sap/ui/qunit/qunit-junit.js\"></script>\n    -   <script src=\"../../resources/sap/ui/qunit/qunit-coverage.js\"\n    +   <script src=\"../../resources/sap/ui/qunit/qunit-coverage-istanbul.js\"\n          data-sap-ui-cover-only=\"ui5/sample/\"\n          data-sap-ui-cover-never=\"ui5/sample/test/\"></script>\n        <script src=\"../../resources/sap/ui/thirdparty/sinon.js\"></script>\n        <script src=\"../../resources/sap/ui/thirdparty/sinon-qunit.js\"></script>\n\n        <script src=\"unitTests.qunit.js\"></script>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <div id=\"qunit\"></div>\n        <div id=\"qunit-fixture\"></div>\n    </body>\n    </html>\n    ```\n\n3. Execute `ui5 serve` in the project root folder\n\n4. Open \"http://localhost:8080/test/unit/unitTests.qunit.html?coverage\" in a browser of your choice\n\n5. Check the code coverage\n  ![Sample for analyzing code coverage](./docs/images/sample-app-coverage-data.png)\n\n### Configuration\n\n`cwd` [String]: Root folder. Defaults to `\"./\"` of the project consuming the middleware.\n\n`excludePatterns` [Array]: Patterns to exclude from instrumenting. Defaults to `[]`.\n\n`report` [Object]: Settings for the reporter.\n\n`report.reporter` [Array]: The report type(s) that would be generated. A list of all the available reports could be found [here](https://github.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs/tree/master/packages/istanbul-reports/lib). Defaults to `[\"html\"]`.\n\n`report[\"report-dir\"]` [String]: Where the reports would be generated. Relative to `cwd`. Defaults to `\"./tmp/coverage-reports\"`.\n\n`report.watermarks` [Object]: Coverage thresholds. See [High and Low Watermarks](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc/blob/ab7c53b2f340b458789a746dff2abd3e2e4790c3/README.md#high-and-low-watermarks) for further details.\n\nDefaults to:\n\n```js\n{\n    statements: [50, 80],\n    functions: [50, 80],\n    branches: [50, 80],\n    lines: [50, 80]\n}\n```\n\n`instrument` [Object]: Settings for the instrumenter. A full set of properties could be seen [here](https://github.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs/blob/master/packages/istanbul-lib-instrument/src/instrumenter.js#L15).\n\nDefaults to:\n\n```js\n{\n    produceSourceMap: true,\n    coverageGlobalScope: \"window.top\",\n    coverageGlobalScopeFunc: false\n}\n```\n\n### Front-End Configuration\n\nYou can override [`watermarks`](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc/blob/ab7c53b2f340b458789a746dff2abd3e2e4790c3/README.md#high-and-low-watermarks) (since UI5 1.119.0) via data attributes in the script tag for `qunit-coverage-istanbul.js`':\n\n```diff html title=\"unitTests.qunit.html\"\n...\n\n    <script src=\"../../resources/sap/ui/qunit/qunit-coverage-istanbul.js\"\n      data-sap-ui-cover-only=\"ui5/sample/\"\n      data-sap-ui-cover-never=\"ui5/sample/test/\"\n+     data-sap-ui-cover-watermarks-statements=\"[90,95]\"\n+     data-sap-ui-cover-watermarks-functions=\"[90,95]\"\n+     data-sap-ui-cover-watermarks-branches=\"[90,95]\"\n+     data-sap-ui-cover-watermarks-lines=\"[90,95]\"></script>\n\n...\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe middleware adds an HTTP endpoint to the development server. For more information about the endpoints, see the [API document](./docs/API.md).\n\nThe custom middleware intercepts every `.js`-file before it is sent to the client. The file is then instrumented on the fly, which includes the dynamic creation of a `sourcemap`.\n\nThe instrumented code and the `sourcemap` are subsequently delivered to the client instead of the original `.js`-file.\n\n## Integration\n\nThe middleware is integrated into OpenUI5 out of the box, but you are not limited by this. With the [configuration](#configuration) and the [public API](./docs/API.md), you can set up the middleware to suit your projects' needs.\n\n### OpenUI5 QUnit Integration\n\nThe `qunit-coverage-istanbul.js` (part of `sap.ui.core` library) file requests the instrumented source files by the middleware. While the tests are running, `qunit-coverage-istanbul.js` takes care of collecting and storing the coverage records into the `window.__coverage__` global variable. After the tests are executed, `qunit-coverage-istanbul.js` sends this data to the middleware, which then generates the code coverage report. Afterwards, the code coverage is displayed on the test page.\n\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease check our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/UI5/cli-extensions/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease check our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/UI5/cli-extensions/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Support\n\nPlease follow our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/UI5/cli-extensions/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#report-an-issue) on how to report an issue.

independent of the backend, OData version and Fiori scenario.  \nThis is made possible by reading the Spreadsheet file and using the standard APIs.  \nThe control will submit not the file, but just the data from the Spreadsheet File.  \nThe integration of the control is designed to be as simple as possible and, in the best case, requires no configuration.\n\n---\n\nThe aim is to support as many Fiori Scenarios and UI5 Versions as possible.  \nSee here for all currently [supported Versions](https://docs.spreadsheet-importer.com/pages/SupportVersions/).\n\n![Spreadsheet Upload Dialog](/images/SpreadsheetUploadDialog.png 'Spreadsheet Upload Dialog')\n\n## Live Demo\n\nIt is possible to try this out directly at:  \nhttps://livedemo.spreadsheet-importer.com/\n\nThe app is an OData V4 app with UI5 version 1.136 and a CAP backend.  \nThe data is reset every hour on the hour.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-cc-spreadsheetimporter\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\nYou

While UI5 is already a powerful framework, there are times you need to integrate it with other UI technologies when business demands.\n\nIn this blog post, we'll explore the blending of React application with UI5 by leveraging a custom UI5 control (UI5Nest) which effortlessly handles loading and embedding React applications. Unlike traditional solutions that rely on iframes, this integration takes advantage of native loading to HTML div elements, ensuring that your React app seamlessly blends with other UI5 controls, acting like any other UI5 control.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://blogs.sap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-19-at-10.13.26.png\" alt=\"Workzone%20view\" />\nAbove Image taken from CF Workzone . Below is the code for this,\n<pre class=\"language-markup\"><code>&lt;mvc:View\n\tcontrollerName=\"nest.controller.Main\"\n\tdisplayBlock=\"true\"\n\txmlns:custom=\"nest.ExtApp\"\n\txmlns=\"sap.m\"\n\txmlns:mvc=\"sap.ui.core.mvc\"&gt;\n  &lt;VBox\n    justifyContent=\"Center\" \n    alignItems=\"Center\" \n    height=\"100%\" &gt;\n  \t&lt;VBox&gt;\n    \t&lt;Title text=\"UI5\"  titleStyle=\"H1\" /&gt;\n      &lt;Button\n        text=\"count is {/count}\"  press=\".onIncrement\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/VBox&gt;\n    &lt;custom:UI5Nest id=\"react\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/VBox&gt;\n&lt;/mvc:View&gt;​</code></pre>\n\n## Managed Router, HTML5 Repository and Build Workzone\n\nYou can deploy to HTML5 Repository like you do it with your UI5 application.\nUI5Nest control integration with Workzone or Fiori Launchpad (on-prem)  is seamless. This means that your React application receives real-time updates for localization and theme changes when events occur.\nYou will receive initial values of the theme and locale in your React app.\nYou will receive these updates again if they change , ensuring you don't miss any updates.\n\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>function onThemeChanged (sTheme) {  \n  //Call central theme change function on App.jsx so it will serve standalone app and nested app\n}\n\nfunction onLocalizationChanged (sLocal) {  \n  //Call central local change function on App.jsx so it will serve standalone app and nested app\n \n}​</code></pre>\n\nIt ensures that your application maintains consistency and synchronicity and delivering a cohesive user experience.\n`generator-ui5-react-nest` scaffolds the necessary files and configurations for managed router. So it is ready to deploying the Workzone service on Cloud Foundry.\n\n## UI5 Generator: `generator-ui5-react-nest`\n\nTo further simplify the process, I have created an UI5 generator for this purpose. This generator is based on pnpm monorepo, which allows for scaffolding UI5 and React applications and local test launchpad such as `launchpad.html` and other necessary files.\n\nThe scaffolded React application uses Vite,  It is modern , easy and fast . React team no longer recommends CRA also . While `react-router-dom` is not included in UI5 generator project, I use it in my projects ( with some modifications for launchpad integration ) and it works fine.\n\nYou should also use UI5 Web Components in your React app, but I chose not to include them in the generator to avoid making it overly opinionated.\n\nAs you will notice, the React application has 2 modes. The first one is standalone. It will act like any other React app. The second mode is UI5 mode. When you use pnpm script `start:ui5` or `build:ui5`, it will make the adjustments in the React app to be available to work in a UI5 app.\n\nAlthough I usually prefer using TypeScript, I have opted for JavaScript in this case for the sake of simplicity and clarity. However, TypeScript is the way I used this method in my projects for both UI5 and React. So it can be easily integrated if desired.\n\nYou can install the ui5 react nest generator and yeoman (if you haven\"t already)\n\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>npm i -g yo generator-ui5-react-nest\nyo ui5-react-nest\n​</code></pre>\n\nBy using the `generator-ui5-react-nest` and following the steps outlined in the blog post <a href=\"https://blogs.sap.com/2023/06/26/nest-react-applications-natively-alongside-ui5/\">Nest React applications natively alongside UI5</a>, you can achieve a smooth integration of React applications with SAP UI5, enabling a consistent and powerful user experience across your projects.\n","downloadsCurrentMonth":-1,"downloadsCurrentFortnight":-1,"downloads365":-1},{"name":"ui5-i18n-excel-converter","version":"0.0.4","description":"CLI tool to convert i18n files to Excel and the other way","main":"src/index.ts","bin":{"ui5-i18n-excel-converter":"./build/index.js"},"scripts":{"dev:export":"tsx watch src/index.ts export ./test/export/i18n ./test/export/export.xlsx -v","dev:import":"tsx watch src/index.ts import ./test/export/export.xlsx ./test/import/i18n -v -d","build":"rimraf build && tsc && tsc-alias","prepublishOnly":"npm run build"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/jchirk/ui5-i18n-excel-converter"},"author":"jchirk","license":"ISC","dependencies":{"commander":"^10.0.0","properties-file":"^3.2.10","winston":"^3.10.0","xlsx":"^0.18.5"},"devDependencies":{"@types/node":"^18.14.0","rimraf":"^5.0.1","tsc-alias":"^1.8.7","tsx":"^3.12.7","typescript":"^4.9.5"},"type":"tooling","tags":["excel","i18n"],"gitHubOwner":"jchirk","gitHubRepo":"ui5-i18n-excel-converter","licenseSource":"gpl-3.0","forks":0,"stars":0,"addedToBoUI5":"2023-08-01T07:53:46.071Z","createdAt":"2023-07-20T14:13:56.675Z","updatedAt":"2023-07-20T15:44:11.650Z","vscodeInstalls":-1,"sourceType":"tooling","githublink":"https://github.com/jchirk/ui5-i18n-excel-converter/tree/master/","readme":"# ui5-i18n-excel-converter\n\nCLI tool to convert i18n files to Excel and the other way\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe purpose of this tool is to easily communicate with the business part regarding the translations of the UI5 application texts (i18n), especially when there are a lot of different languages.\n\nThe tool will generate the Excel file with the keys and the languages.\nThe translators just have to put the translated texts on the corresponding cells.\nThen the tool will import from the Excel file all the translations into the i18n files.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall with npm\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev ui5-i18n-excel-converter\n```\n    \n## Quick start\n\nInstall the tool with npm (see [Installation](#installation)).\n\nAdd these scipts to your package.json file :\n\n```javascript\n{\n    ...\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"i18n:export\": \"ui5-i18n-excel-converter export\",   // i18n -> Excel\n        \"i18n:import\": \"ui5-i18n-excel-converter import\"    // Excel -> i18n\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can tweak these scripts using the options in [Usage](#usage).\n## Usage\n\n```\nUsage: ui5-i18n-excel-converter [options] [command]\n\nCLI tool to convert i18n files to Excel and the other way\n\nOptions:\n  -h, --help                                   display help for command\n\nCommands:\n  export [options] [i18n_folder] [excel_file]  convert properties files to Excel\n  import [options] [excel_file] [i18n_folder]  import data from Excel file and update the i18n properties files (if the file doesn't exist it will be created)\n  help [command]                               display help for command\n```\n\n### Export\n```\nUsage: ui5-i18n-excel-converter export [options] [i18n_folder] [excel_file]\n\nconvert properties files to Excel\n\nArguments:\n  i18n_folder    i18n folder (default: \"./webapp/i18n\")\n  excel_file     excel file\n\nOptions:\n  -v, --verbose  display logs (default: false)\n  -h, --help     display help for command\n```\n\n### Import\n```\nUsage: ui5-i18n-excel-converter import [options] [excel_file] [i18n_folder]\n\nimport data from Excel file and update the i18n properties files (if the file doesn't exist it will be created)\n\nArguments:\n  excel_file     excel file (default: \"./<project_name>.xlsx\")\n  i18n_folder    i18n folder (default: \"./webapp/i18n\")\n\nOptions:\n  -v, --verbose  display logs (default: false)\n  -d, --delete   delete properties keys if not present in excel file (default: false)\n  -h, --help     display help for command\n```\n## Acknowledgements\n -

The [`ui5-tooling-modules`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-tooling-modules) tooling extension can be used to generate the UI5 Control wrappers for [UI5 Web Components](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/). With `ui5-tooling-modules` all UI5 Web Components can be used like regular npm modules by simply requiring them and use them like UI5 Controls in JS/TS or XML without any configuration.**\n\n--------------------\n\n# UI5 Tooling for Web Components\n\nProvides [UI5 Tooling](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/) Extensions to include [UI5 Web Components](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/) projects into [OpenUI5](https://openui5.org/) / [SAPUI5](https://ui5.sap.com).\n\n> **Attention**: This project is in an experimental state. Significant changes are likely to occur, including potential breaking changes.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe repository contains the NPM package: `@ui5/tooling-webc`. This package provides scripts to prebuild and generate UI5 library wrapper projects for UI5 Web Components and a custom middleware to be used for the development of UI5 library wrapper projects and a direct consumption of the UI5 Web Components projects. In other words, it enables to use UI5 Web Components as OpenUI5/SAPUI5 controls. \n\nInside this package the most important scripts can be found at the following places:\n\n```text\nbin\n├── generate.js   // generation binary => ui5-webc-generate\n└── prebuild.js   // prebuild binary => ui5-webc-prebuild\n\nlib\n├── generate.js   // generation script\n├── prebuild.js   // prebuild script\n├── middleware.js // UI5 server middleware for serving web-components-based projects\n└── task.js       // UI5 build task for third-party libraries only\n```\n\n*Note: Starting from version `0.3.0` only the Custom Elements Manifest format is supported for the purpose of wrapper generation*\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Requirements\n\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (**version 16 or higher**)\n- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en)\n\n### Setup\n\nThe project is using `npm`. To get started with the local development, just run the following commands:\n\n```sh\n# Install dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Create a link\nnpm link\n```\n\nNow you can link the package for local testing by calling the following command: \n\n```sh\n# Link it\nnpm install @ui5/tooling-webc\n```\n\nThat's it, all set!\n\n### Consumption\n\n#### 1. Add the dependency\n\nUse the NPM package manager of your choice to add the `@ui5/tooling-webc` as a `devDependency` to your UI5 library:\n\n```shell\n# NPM\nnpm i --save-dev @ui5/tooling-webc\n\n# yarn\nyarn add -D @ui5/tooling-webc\n\n# PNPM\npnpm add -D @ui5/tooling-webc\n```\n\n#### 2. Configure the tooling extension\n\nAdd the necessary configuration to your UI5 library in the `ui5.yaml` file. The configuration should go to `customConfiguration` -> `ui5-tooling-webc`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```yaml\ncustomConfiguration:\n  ui5-tooling-webc:\n    <YOUR CONFIGURATION GOES HERE>\n```\n\nFor more details on the supported `ui5-tooling-webc:` configuration settings, click [here](./docs/settings.md).\n\n### 3. Use the binaries\n\nThe tooling extension comes with two binaries which can be called directly (eventually by using `npx`):\n\n```sh\n# create the runtime for the web components\nui5-webc-prebuild\n\n# create the wrapper controls\nui5-webc-generate\n```\n\nOptionally, add these as part of your library's build tasks:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"prebuild\": \"ui5-webc-prebuild\",\n    \"generate\": \"ui5-webc-generate\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Using the middleware\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n    ```json\n    \"devDependencies\": {\n        // ...\n        \"@ui5/tooling-webc\": \"*\"\n        // ...\n    },\n    \"ui5\": {\n      \"dependencies\": [\n        // ...\n        \"@ui5/tooling-webc\",\n        // ...\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n    > As the devDependencies are not recognized by the UI5 tooling, they need to be listed in the `ui5 > dependencies` array. In addition, once using the `ui5 > dependencies` array you need to list all UI5 tooling relevant dependencies.\n\n2. Configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n    ```yaml\n    server:\n      customMiddleware:\n        - name: ui5-tooling-webc-middleware\n          afterMiddleware: compression\n    ```\n\nThat's all.\n\n## Support, Feedback, Contributing\n\nThis project is open to feature requests/suggestions, bug reports etc. via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling-webc/issues).

It should also be easier for our customers to distinguish really important logs from \"standard warnings\" etc.\n\nSaid and done. The result of my considerations is [the following library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/srbjslogger).\n\n**Features:**\\\nA number of JS methods that allow us to create very prominent log outputs.\\\nWith the creation of the library, I also implemented a requirement that was long overdue. With the command `SRBJSLogger.developer(true, {obi: \"wan kenobi\"});` very important details for us are displayed in the browser log. Among other things, \"which browser is used\", \"screen size\" etc. A very nice feature is setting the first parameter to true. If this parameter is activated, the browser console provides a QR code with the content of the most important application information. ( Additional data can also be packed into the QR code - see \"Obi Wan Kenobi\" )\n\n## Getting started\n\n**Initialize the SRBJSLogger via the NPM CDN:**\n\nFor initializing the Logger via CDN, simply copy and paste the following in the index file of the HTML5 app:\n\n```markup\n<script src=\"https://npmcdn.com/srbjslogger/SRBJSLogger.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n**Initialize the SRBJSLogger via downloading the latest version:**\n\nDownload the latest minified version from [here](https://npmcdn.com/srbjslogger/SRBJSLogger.min.js). Place that file into a directory of the app's folder structure, where it can access that file. For UI5 apps, using the index.html bootrapping, instantiate the Logger like above via\n\n```markup\n<script src=\"/path/to/SRBJSLogger.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nFor UI5 apps, not using the index.html startup logic, paste the following in the ressources section of the manifest file:\n\n```json\n\"resources\": { \"js\": [ { \"uri\": \"path/to/SRBJSLogger.min.js\" } ] }\n```\n\n**Initialize the Logger temporarily via the browsers console.

slowly piling up and support is becoming increasingly difficult.\nIt is of course important for us to be able to identify errors quickly, simplify analyzes and be able to react quickly to problems.\n\nFor this reason I developed the JS Library SRBInfoAndSupport.js.\nThis gives us the opportunity to evaluate important information quickly and easily.\n\n**The most important information for error identification includes:**\n\n- Browser designation ( version )\n- Screen size\n- URL of the application ( incl. port, hostname, path )\n- Device Zoom\n- Version of our product (last Git commit)\n- What data is in the local storage\n- Screenshot of the application\n- ...\n\nThe most common application of the library will probably be to display a button that shows the user the important information mentioned above. This is very easy to do with the Lib. Simply integrate it into the project and a dialog is presented to the user with the following function call:\n\n```js\nSRBInfoAndSupport.showSupportDialog(\"My dialog title\", {​​\n   captureScreenshot: true,\n}​​);\n```\n\nThis call results in:\n![Alt text](ressources/images/showSupportDialog.png)\n\nAs can be seen in the screenshot, the users/developers now have the option of sending the data via email or copying it to the clipboard.\n\nFurthermore, it is mandatory for legal reasons to display licenses.\nBoth our product licenses and licenses for the libraries we use (open source libs etc.)\n\nThis is also covered by SRBInfoAndSupport.js. Using the following function call...\n\n```js\nSRBInfoAndSupport.showOverviewDialog(\"Title\");\n```\n\n...a dialog is generated that displays all important information:\n\n![Alt text](ressources/images/showOverviewDialog.png)\n\n### Important technical background:\n\nAll displayed fixed data is loaded dynamically from configuration files. This has a significant advantage when making the library dynamic. For example, in the case of licenses, a JSON file containing the licenses is loaded from the configuration. If it is necessary to display a new license due to an extension of the application, this can simply be added to the configuration.\n\n**Here's an example:**\n\n![Alt text](ressources/images/licenses.png)\n\n# [Demo](https://srbconsultingteam.github.io/SRBInfoAndSupportJS/demo/webapp/index.html)\n\nIf you check out this project, there is a \"demo\" app to see how the library works. Simply clone the repo and run `npm run test` in the demo folder ( `npm install` required to install all necessary packages ).\n\nYou can also use this link to see a working example:\nhttps://srbconsultingteam.github.io/SRBInfoAndSupportJS/demo/webapp/index.html\n\n## Getting started\n\n**Initialize the SRBJSLogger via the NPM CDN:**\n\nFor initializing the Logger via CDN, simply copy and paste the following in the index file of the HTML5 app:\n\n```markup\n<script src=\"https://npmcdn.com/srbinfoandsupportjs/src/SRBInfoAndSupport.js\"></script>\n```\n\nOr use the minified version\n\n```markup\n<script src=\"https://npmcdn.com/srbinfoandsupportjs/src/SRBInfoAndSupport.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n**Initialize SRBInfoAndSupportJS via downloading the latest version:**\n\nDownload the latest minified version from [here](https://npmcdn.com/srbinfoandsupportjs/src/SRBInfoAndSupport.min.js). Place that file into a directory of the app's folder structure, where it can access that file. For UI5 apps, using the index.html bootrapping, instantiate the Logger like above via\n\n```markup\n<script src=\"/path/to/SRBInfoAndSupport.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nFor UI5 apps, not using the index.html startup logic, paste the following in the ressources section of the manifest file:\n\n```json\n\"resources\": { \"js\": [ { \"uri\": \"path/to/SRBInfoAndSupport.min.js\" } ] }\n```\n\n**Initialize the Logger temporarily via the browsers console. Just copy, paste and execute the following snippet in the browsers console:**\n\n```js\nvar script = document.createElement(\"script\");\nscript.type = \"text/javascript\";\nscript.src = \"https://npmcdn.com/srbinfoandsupportjs/src/SRBInfoAndSupport.min.js\";\nscript.addEventListener(\"load\", function () {\n  SRBInfoAndSupport.init({\n    appname: \"My testing app\",\n    version: \"1.1.1\",\n    licenses: { MyLicense: \"ABCABC\" },\n    copyright: \"My version of the copyright\",\n    latestCommitHash: \"asf82oap\",\n  });\n});\n\ndocument.head.appendChild(script);\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\n> The documentation on this page is just an overview of the most relevant functions and features. Consider reading the [JSDoc page!](./SRBInfoAndSupport_JSDOC.md)\n\n### The init function\n\n```js\nSRBInfoAndSupport.init({\n  appname: \"My testing app\",\n  version: \"1.1.1\",\n  licenses: { MyLicense: \"ABCABC\" },\n  copyright: \"My version of the copyright\",\n  latestCommitHash: \"asf82oap\",\n});\n```\n\nor, if using the manifest properties instead:\n\n```js\nSRBInfoAndSupport.init();\n```\n\n**Parameters**\\\n\\\n`init(config[{}])`\n\n- **config** - optional\n  Configuration object for the init function. If provided, the following config object has to be used:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"appname\": \"\",\n    \"version\": \"\",\n    \"licenses\": {\n      \"MyLicense\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"copyright\": \"\",\n    \"latestCommitHash\": \"asf82oap\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n  If this configuration object is not provided, the library is searching for manifest properties of the UI5 app, that is using the library.\n\n  Example manifest.json configuration:\n\n  ```json\n    {\n      \"_version\": \"1.0.162\",\n      \"_srbVersionInfo\": {\n        \"productName\": \"My Product\",\n        \"latestCommitHash\": \"3704aa5\",\n        \"copyright\": \"© Copyright 2022 SRB Consulting Team GmbH. All Rights Reserved.\",\n        \"licenses\": {\n          \"My Product License\": \"\",\n          \"html2canvas\": \"Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. Permission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any purpose with or without fee is hereby granted. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS' AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.

This library is not shipped with the SRBInfoAndSupportJS. See https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas for how to initialize the library.\n\n    Quick and dirty example that is initializing `html2canvas`. You can use it in the browser console:\n\n    ```js\n    var script = document.createElement(\"script\");\n    script.type = \"text/javascript\";\n    script.src = \"https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas/releases/download/v1.4.1/html2canvas.min.js\";\n    document.head.appendChild(script);\n    ```\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"captureScreenshot\": true\n  }\n  ```\n\n\\\n\\\n**Results in**\n\n![Alt text](./images/showSupportDialog.png)\n\n---\n\n### The overview dialog function\n\n```js\nSRBInfoAndSupport.showOverviewDialog(\"Title\");\n```\n\n**Parameters**\\\n\\\n`showOverviewDialog(title[String])`\n\n- **title**\n\n  The title of the info dialog\n\n**Results in**\n\n![Alt text](./images/showOverviewDialog.png)\n\n### The initializing hidden info\n\nThis function initializes a hidden feature. The feature is open the overview dialog or the support dialog, or both. The magic thing is that the dialogs are shown only after clicking on a specific DOM element a specific number of times in a specific time range. The number of clicks is `10` in a time range of `2000` milliseconds.\n\nThe DOM element that has to be clicked can be forwarded to the function via the parameter `domElementId`.

Last but not least, the message tone.\n\nIn pure web applications, haptic/physical feedback is rarely used. That's why we created this library. There are many business applications where providing haptic feedback would be very helpful. Vibration or sound feedback is a very good way to increase the user experience, especially in business processes where loud background noise or poor visibility of the screen impairs usability.\n\n### Important technical background:\n\n- The library can't vibrate devices, that have no vibration unit installed ;)\n- For soundfeedback, you can use any type of speaker that the device supports ( Bluetooth speaker, headphones, ... )\n- Check if your browser supports vibrating a compatible device: https://caniuse.com/vibration\n- Check if your browser supports playing audio via JavaScript: https://caniuse.com/audio\n\n# [Demo](https://srbconsultingteam.github.io/SRBPhysicalFeedbackJS/demo/webapp/index.html)\n\nIf you check out this project, there is a \"demo\" app to see how the library works. Simply clone the repo and run `npm run test` in the demo folder ( `npm install` required to install all necessary packages ).\n\nYou can also use this link to see a working example:\nhttps://srbconsultingteam.github.io/SRBPhysicalFeedbackJS/demo/webapp/index.html\n\n## Getting started\n\n**Initialize the SRBPhysicalFeedbackJS via the NPM CDN:**\n\nFor initializing the library via CDN, simply copy and paste the following in the index file of the HTML5 app:\n\n```markup\n<script src=\"https://npmcdn.com/srbphysicalfeedbackjs/src/SRBPhysicalFeedback.js\"></script>\n```\n\nOr use the minified version\n\n```markup\n<script src=\"https://npmcdn.com/srbphysicalfeedbackjs/src/SRBPhysicalFeedback.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n**Initialize SRBPhysicalFeedbackJS via downloading the latest version:**\n\nDownload the latest minified version from [here](https://npmcdn.com/srbphysicalfeedbackjs/src/SRBPhysicalFeedback.min.js). Place that file into a directory of the app's folder structure, where it can access that file. For UI5 apps, using the index.html bootrapping, instantiate the Library like below via\n\n```markup\n<script src=\"/path/to/SRBPhysicalFeedback.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nFor UI5 apps, not using the index.html startup logic, paste the following in the ressources section of the manifest file:\n\n```json\n\"resources\": { \"js\": [ { \"uri\": \"path/to/SRBPhysicalFeedback.min.js\" } ] }\n```\n\n**Initialize the Library temporarily via the browsers console. Just copy, paste and execute the following snippet in the browsers console:**\n\n```js\nvar script = document.createElement(\"script\");\nscript.type = \"text/javascript\";\nscript.src = \"https://npmcdn.com/srbphysicalfeedbackjs/src/SRBPhysicalFeedback.min.js\";\nscript.addEventListener(\"load\", function () {\n  alert(\"Playing sound pattern C\");\n  SRBPhysicalFeedback.soundFeedback(\"C\");\n  alert(\"Now vibrating pattern A\");\n  SRBPhysicalFeedback.vibrationFeedback(\"A\");\n});\n\ndocument.head.appendChild(script);\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\n> The documentation on this page is just an overview of the most relevant functions and features. Consider reading the [JSDoc page!](./SRBPhysicalFeedback_JSDOC.md)\n\n## Supported devices\n\n|  #  |          Device          |     OS     | Browser    |  Sound supported   | Vibration supported |\n| :-: | :----------------------: | :--------: | ---------- | :----------------: | :-----------------: |\n|  1  | Samsung Galaxy S22 ultra | Android 13 | Chrome 117 | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark:  |\n|  2  |     Apple iPhone 13      | iOS 16.6.1 | Chrome 117 | :white_check_mark: |         :x:         |\n|  3  |    Samsung Galaxy S8     | Android 9  | Chrome 117 | :white_check_mark: |         :x:         |\n|  4  |       Zebra MC220K       | Android 9  | Chrome 117 | :white_check_mark: |         :x:         |\n\nPlease also note your device details if you tested it, and [create an issue](https://github.com/SRBConsultingTeam/SRBPhysicalFeedbackJS/issues/new?title=Please%20add%20my%20device%20to%20the%20supported%20devices%20list) with the information from the table above!\n\n**Device:** `Device name`\n**OS:** `Operating system`\n**Browser:** `Browser and version`\n**Sound supported:** `yes/no`\n**Vibration supported:** `yes/no`\n","downloadsCurrentMonth":14,"downloadsCurrentFortnight":7,"downloads365":283,"downloadsFortnightGrowth":0,"downloadsHistory":[{"yearMonth":"2025-01","downloads":38},{"yearMonth":"2025-02","downloads":31},{"yearMonth":"2025-03","downloads":21},{"yearMonth":"2025-04","downloads":30},{"yearMonth":"2025-05","downloads":11},{"yearMonth":"2025-06","downloads":19},{"yearMonth":"2025-07","downloads":15},{"yearMonth":"2025-08","downloads":16},{"yearMonth":"2025-09","downloads":18},{"yearMonth":"2025-10","downloads":29},{"yearMonth":"2025-11","downloads":40}],"npmlink":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/srbphysicalfeedbackjs","versions":[{"version":"created","date":"2023-10-04T12:21:41.226Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/srbphysicalfeedbackjs/v/created","changelog":"","sourceType":"library"},{"version":"1.0.0","date":"2023-10-04T12:21:41.562Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/srbphysicalfeedbackjs/v/1.0.0","changelog":"","sourceType":"library"},{"version":"modified","date":"2023-10-05T13:13:48.290Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/srbphysicalfeedbackjs/v/modified","changelog":"","sourceType":"library"},{"version":"1.0.1","date":"2023-10-04T12:26:45.340Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/srbphysicalfeedbackjs/v/1.0.1","changelog":"","sourceType":"library"},{"version":"1.0.2","date":"2023-10-05T09:14:40.282Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/srbphysicalfeedbackjs/v/1.0.2","changelog":"","sourceType":"library"},{"version":"1.0.3","date":"2023-10-05T12:42:22.810Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/srbphysicalfeedbackjs/v/1.0.3","changelog":"","sourceType":"library"},{"version":"1.0.4","date":"2023-10-05T12:44:52.545Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/srbphysicalfeedbackjs/v/1.0.4","changelog":"","sourceType":"library"},{"version":"1.0.5","date":"2023-10-05T13:13:48.086Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/srbphysicalfeedbackjs/v/1.0.5","changelog":"","sourceType":"library"}]},{"name":"ui5-cc-timerbutton","version":"0.5.2","description":"UI5 Library with a timerbutton.

A browser window with the URL pointing to your controls' test page should automatically open.\n\n(When using yarn, do `yarn start` instead.)\n\n## Debug the Library\n\nIn the browser, you can directly debug the original TypeScript code, which is supplied via sourcemaps (need to be enabled in the browser's developer console if it does not work straight away). If the browser doesn't automatically jump to the TypeScript code when setting breakpoints, use e.g. `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `P` in Chrome to open the `*.ts` file you want to debug.\n\n## Build the Library\n\n### Unoptimized (but quick)\n\nExecute the following command to build the project and get an app that can be deployed:\n\n```sh\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThe result is placed into the `dist` folder. To start the generated package, just run\n\n```sh\nnpm run start:dist\n```\n\nNote that HTML page still loads the UI5 framework from the relative URL `resources/...`, which does not physically exist, but is only provided dynamically by the UI5 tooling. So for an actual deployment you should change this URL to either [the CDN](https://sdk.openui5.org/#/topic/2d3eb2f322ea4a82983c1c62a33ec4ae) or your local deployment of UI5.\n\n(When using yarn, do `yarn build` and `yarn start:dist` instead.)\n\n## Check the Code\n\nDo the following to run a TypeScript check:\n\n```sh\nnpm run ts-typecheck\n```\n\nThis checks the libraries code for any type errors (but will also complain in case of fundamental syntax issues which break the parsing).\n\nTo lint the TypeScript code, do:\n\n```sh\nnpm run lint\n```\n\n(Again, when using yarn, do `yarn ts-typecheck` and `yarn lint` instead.)\n\n## Deploy to ABAP server \n\nTo deploy and use the library to an ABAP server (e.g. SAP Netweaver 7.50) you can do the following (there are other ways to achieve this).\n\nInstall the `nwabap:upload` npm package   \n`npm install nwabap:upload`\n\nIn the root folder of your project create a file `.nwabaprc`.  \nThe file should have the following content (adjust to your needs):\n```\n{\n    \"base\": \"./dist/resources\",\n    \"conn_server\": \"https://abapserver.my.lan:50001\",\n    \"conn_usestrictssl\": \"false\",\n    \"conn_user\": \"<Your ABAP user name>\",\n    \"conn_password\": \"<Your ABAP user password>\",\n    \"conn_client\": \"001\",\n    \"abap_language\": \"DE\",\n    \"abap_package\": \"Z_APPS\",\n    \"abap_bsp\": \"ZGP_LIB_CTRLS\",\n    \"abap_bsp_text\": \"UI5 library mit TimerButton\",\n    \"abap_transport\": \"XXXK9999999\",\n    \"files_start_with_dot\" : \"true\",\n    \"calcappindex\": true\n}\n```\nIt's important that this configuration contains the undocumented `files_start_with_dot: true` line cause otherwise the `.library` file \nwill not be deployed.  \n\nAfter you created this file just run `npm run deploy`.  \nYou will see something like this in transaction `se80`.\n\n![ABAP Deployment](docs/img/ZGP_LIB_CTRLS.png)\n\n### Use your library in UI5 app \n\nTo use the controls in your UI5 apps just add it to your `manifest.json`\n\n```\n  \"sap.ui5\": {\n    ...\n    ...\n    \"dependencies\": {\n      \"minUI5Version\": \"1.108.19\",\n      \"libs\": {\n        \"sap.ui.core\": {},\n        \"sap.ui.layout\": {},\n        \"sap.m\": {},\n        \"ui5.cc.timerbutton\": {}\n      }\n    },\n```\n\nNow you can use the control in your views \n\n```\n<mvc:View\n\tcontrollerName=\"my.namespace.controller.Main\"\n\tdisplayBlock=\"true\"\n\txmlns=\"sap.m\"\n\txmlns:core=\"sap.ui.core\"\n\txmlns:l=\"sap.ui.layout\"\n  xmlns:timerbtn=\"ui5.cc.timerbutton\">\n\n  ...\n  ...\n  ...\n\n        <timerbtn:TimerButton\n          id='btnSaveChanges'\n          text=\"{i18n>save}\"\n          timeout=\"15000\"\n          timeoutButtonText=\"{i18n>timeoutbutton.timeouttext}\"\n          type=\"Success\"\n          press=\".onSaveChanges\"\n        />\n```\n\n### Use the library at dev time on localhost \n\nMost developers develop their UI5 application on their local PC and access the app locally at `http://localhost...`.  \nThis is achieved by using `ui5 serve` from the UI5 tooling.  \nCause you cannot access the ABAP runtime from there you need to tell your local server (aka ui5 serve) where to find the \nlibrary.  \n\nInstall the `ui5.cc.timerbutton` as dev dependency.  \n`npm install -D ui5-cc-timerbutton`\n\nThen add the following to your `ui5.yaml`.  \nIt's important that the `ui5-middleware-servestatic` follows the proxy middleware (fiori-tools-proxy in my case) cause otherwise \nthe timerbutton mountPath will not be available.\n\n```\nserver:\n    customMiddleware:\n        - name: ui5-middleware-livereload\n          afterMiddleware: compression\n          configuration:\n              debug: true\n              extraExts: 'xml,json,properties'\n              port: 35729\n              path: 'webapp'\n        - name: fiori-tools-proxy\n          afterMiddleware: compression\n          configuration:\n              ignoreCertError: true # If set to true, certificate errors will be ignored. E.g. self-signed certificates will be accepted\n              ui5:\n                  path:\n                      - /resources\n                      - /test-resources\n                  url: https://ui5.sap.com\n        - name: ui5-middleware-servestatic\n          afterMiddleware: compression\n          mountPath: /resources/ui5/cc/timerbutton/\n          configuration:\n            rootPath: ./node_modules/ui5-cc-timerbutton/dist/resources/ui5/cc/timerbutton/\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License, except as noted otherwise in the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.\n\n---\n\n###### This template is provided to you by Wouter Lemaire and contributors :wink:\n","downloadsCurrentMonth":4,"downloadsCurrentFortnight":1,"downloads365":247,"downloadsFortnightGrowth":-66.67,"downloadsHistory":[{"yearMonth":"2025-01","downloads":24},{"yearMonth":"2025-02","downloads":12},{"yearMonth":"2025-03","downloads":15},{"yearMonth":"2025-04","downloads":15},{"yearMonth":"2025-05","downloads":4},{"yearMonth":"2025-06","downloads":10},{"yearMonth":"2025-07","downloads":6},{"yearMonth":"2025-08","downloads":10},{"yearMonth":"2025-09","downloads":21},{"yearMonth":"2025-10","downloads":105},{"yearMonth":"2025-11","downloads":23}],"npmlink":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-cc-timerbutton","versions":[{"version":"created","date":"2024-01-28T15:26:05.627Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-cc-timerbutton/v/created","changelog":"","sourceType":"library"},{"version":"1.0.0","date":"2024-01-28T15:26:05.801Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-cc-timerbutton/v/1.0.0","changelog":"","sourceType":"library"},{"version":"modified","date":"2024-03-18T17:50:16.636Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-cc-timerbutton/v/modified","changelog":"","sourceType":"library"},{"version":"1.0.1","date":"2024-01-28T16:48:29.926Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-cc-timerbutton/v/1.0.1","changelog":"","sourceType":"library"},{"version":"1.0.2","date":"2024-01-28T16:56:40.734Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-cc-timerbutton/v/1.0.2","changelog":"","sourceType":"library"},{"version":"0.9.0","date":"2024-01-28T17:08:00.014Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-cc-timerbutton/v/0.9.0","changelog":"","sourceType":"library"},{"version":"0.5.0","date":"2024-01-28T17:31:43.988Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-cc-timerbutton/v/0.5.0","changelog":"","sourceType":"library"},{"version":"0.5.1","date":"2024-01-30T10:23:23.043Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-cc-timerbutton/v/0.5.1","changelog":"","sourceType":"library"},{"version":"0.5.2","date":"2024-03-18T17:50:15.683Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-cc-timerbutton/v/0.5.2","changelog":"","sourceType":"library"}]},{"name":"ui5-antares","version":"1.124.1003","description":"UI5 Antares is a set of some useful classes and methods to speed up the development time for OData operations in SAPUI5 applications.","scripts":{"build":"ui5 build preload --clean-dest --config ui5-npm.yaml --exclude-task=minify && node correct-types.js"},"repository":{"url":"https://github.com/hasanciftci26/ui5-antares"},"homepage":"https://ui5-antares.github.io","keywords":["SAPUI5","UI5","OData"],"files":["dist","ui5.yaml","LICENSE","README.md","CHANGELOG.md"],"types":"dist/index.d.ts","author":"Hasan Çiftçi (hasanciftcii26@gmail.com)","license":"Apache-2.0","devDependencies":{"@sap-ux/eslint-plugin-fiori-tools":"^0.4.1","@sapui5/types":"1.124.1","@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin":"^7.7.0","@typescript-eslint/parser":"^7.7.0","@ui5/cli":"^3.9.2","replace-in-file":"^7.1.0","typescript":"^5.4.5","ui5-task-no-debug-files":"^0.0.5","ui5-tooling-transpile":"^3.4.0"},"type":"library","tags":["odata","dialog","entry"],"gitHubOwner":"hasanciftci26","gitHubRepo":"ui5-antares","licenseSource":"apache-2.0","forks":0,"stars":5,"addedToBoUI5":"2024-09-03T08:26:00.057Z","createdAt":"2024-04-24T08:25:23.559Z","updatedAt":"2024-08-14T15:11:46.043Z","vscodeInstalls":-1,"sourceType":"library","githublink":"https://github.com/hasanciftci26/ui5-antares/tree/master/","readme":"# UI5 Antares\r\n\r\n[TS_URL]: https://www.typescriptlang.org\r\n[SAPUI5_URL]: https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\r\n[UI5_LICENSE_URL]: https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/developer-license-3_2.txt\r\n[ANTARES_URL]: #ui5-antares\r\n\r\nThe UI5 Antares is a custom SAPUI5 library comprising useful classes and methods, specifically designed to streamline the development process when working with OData V2 services.\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> UI5 Antares is developed in [TypeScript][TS_URL] and is compatible with both SAPUI5 JavaScript and SAPUI5 TypeScript applications.\r\n\r\n> [!CAUTION]\r\n> This library utilizes the classes and components of the [SAPUI5][SAPUI5_URL] framework without modifying or copying the source code, which is licensed under the [SAP Developer License][UI5_LICENSE_URL].

projects.\nIt checks JavaScript, TypeScript, XML, JSON, and other files in your project and reports findings.\n\n## Features\nUI5 linter scans your UI5 project and detects issues that might interfere with its smooth running with [UI5 2.x](https://community.sap.com/t5/open-source-blogs/introducing-openui5-2-x/ba-p/13580633). In particular, note that all APIs and features that were deprecated with or before UI5 1.136 are no longer available in UI5 version 2.x. The hints and fixes provided by UI5 linter therefore target a UI5 runtime of version 1.136 or newer. UI5 linter reports findings for deprecations in the following areas:\n\n* Usage of deprecated UI5 libraries \n* Usage of deprecated UI5 framework APIs \n* Usage of global variables \n* Possible CSP violations \n* Deprecated component and manifest configurations  \n\n> [!NOTE]\n> While UI5 linter already provides many detection features, it is not yet covering all aspects and best practices for UI5 2.x. The intention of UI5 linter is to detect as many issues as possible that a project running with UI5 2.x might be facing. However, you'll still need to test your UI5 project with UI5 2.x as soon as it is made available. To reveal additional issues, the UI5 team plans to release more versions of UI5 linter over the next months. \n\n## Rules\n\nUI5 linter comes with a set of predefined rules that are enabled by default. You can disable specific rules in the code via [Directives](#directives).\n\nA list of all available rules can be found on the [Rules](./docs/Rules.md) page.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) Version v20.11.x, v22.0.0, or higher\n- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) Version v8.0.0 or higher\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the CLI using the npm package manager:\n\n```sh\n# Global\nnpm install --global @ui5/linter\n\n# In your project\nnpm install --save-dev @ui5/linter\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nRun the `ui5lint [files...]` command in your project root folder\n\n```sh\n> ui5lint\n\nUI5 linter report:\n\n/application/webapp/controller/App.controller.js\n  10:4 error Call to deprecated function 'attachTap' of class 'Button'  no-deprecated-api\n\n/application/webapp/manifest.json\n  81:17 error Use of deprecated model type 'sap.ui5/models/odata/type=\"sap.ui.model.odata.ODataModel\"'  no-deprecated-api\n\n/application/webapp/test/unit/unitTests.qunit.js\n  6:1 error Call to deprecated function 'attachInit' of class 'Core'  no-deprecated-api\n  6:1 error Call to deprecated function 'getCore' (sap.ui.getCore)  no-deprecated-api\n  6:1 error Access of global variable 'sap' (sap.ui.getCore)  no-globals\n\n/application/webapp/view/Main.view.xml\n  16:39 error Import of deprecated module 'sap/m/MessagePage'  no-deprecated-api\n  22:5  error Use of deprecated property 'blocked' of class 'Button'  no-deprecated-api\n\n7 problems (7 errors, 0 warnings)\n\nNote: Use \"ui5lint --details\" to show more information about the findings\n```\n\nYou can provide multiple glob patterns as arguments after the `ui5lint` command to filter and narrow down the linting results. \n\n**Note**: This option does not permit you to include files that normally wouldn't be checked (e.g. files outside of the `webapp` folder in application projects).\n\n**Note**: Only POSIX separators are allowed, regardless of the target platform.\n\n```sh\n> ui5lint \"webapp/**/*.xml\"\n\nUI5 linter report:\n\n/application/webapp/view/Main.view.xml\n  16:39 error Import of deprecated module 'sap/m/MessagePage'  no-deprecated-api\n  22:5  error Use of deprecated property 'blocked' of class 'Button'  no-deprecated-api\n\n2 problems (2 errors, 0 warnings)\n\nNote: Use \"ui5lint --details\" to show more information about the findings\n```\n\n### Options\n\n#### `--details`\n\nShow more information about the findings and how to fix them.\n\n**Example:**\n```sh\nui5lint --details\n```\n\n#### `--format`\n\nChoose the output format. Currently, `stylish` (default), `json`, `markdown`, and `html` are supported.\n\n**Example:**\n```sh\nui5lint --format json\n```\n\nTo save the output to a file, use the `>` operator (works on macOS, Linux, and Windows):\n\n**Save to File:**\n```sh\nui5lint --format markdown > ui5-linter-findings.md\n```\n\n#### `--fix`\n\nAttempt to automatically correct certain findings.\n\n**Example::**\n```sh\nui5lint --fix\n```\n\nCurrently, issues of the following rules are fixable:\n- no-globals: Usage of globals that are part of UI5 (e.g. `sap.m.Button`) are replaced by the corresponding module import (in JS files)\n- no-deprecated-api: Usage of deprecated APIs\n  - Usages of some deprecated APIs on `sap.ui.getCore().getConfiguration()` a.k.a. \"Configuration Facade\" are replaced by the corresponding recommended APIs (in JS files)\n  - Usages of some deprecated APIs on `sap.ui.getCore()` a.k.a. \"Core Facade\" are replaced by the corresponding recommended APIs (in JS files)\n  - Usages of the deprecated `tap` event handler on `sap/m/Button` are replaced by the recommended `press` event handler (in JS and XML files). Also, the associated event handler methods `attachTap` and `dettachTap` are replaced by the corresponding `attachPress` and `detachPress` methods.\n  - Usages of the deprecated `useExportToExcel` property on `sap/ui/comp/smarttable/SmartTable` are replaced by the `enableExport` property (in JS and XML files)\n  - Usages of the deprecated `synchronizationMode` property on `sap/ui/model/odata/v4/ODataModel` are removed (in JS files)\n  - Usages of the deprecated `minWidth` property on `sap/ui/layout/form/SimpleForm` are removed (in JS and XML files)\n  - Usages of deprecated attributes in a UI5 bootstrap script are replaced by the corresponding recommended attributes (in HTML files)\n\nAfter applying fixes, the linter runs another pass to detect any remaining issues. Not all findings may be fixable, so those issues may need to be addressed manually. See [Scope of Autofix](./docs/Scope-of-Autofix.md) for examples of APIs that cannot be migrated automatically. Note that this list is not exhaustive; there are more APIs that are currently not supported by the Autofix.\n\n##### Dry Run Mode\nTo preview the results without modifying any files, set the UI5LINT_FIX_DRY_RUN environment variable:\n\n```sh\nUI5LINT_FIX_DRY_RUN=true ui5lint --fix\n```\n\nIn this mode, the linter will show the messages after the fixes would have been applied but will not actually change the files.\n\n#### `--quiet`\n\nReport errors only, hiding warnings. Similar to ESLint's `--quiet` option.\n\n**Example:**\n```sh\nui5lint --quiet\n```\n\n#### `--ignore-pattern`\n\nPattern/files that will be ignored during linting. Can also be defined in `ui5lint.config.js`.\n\n**Example:**\n```sh\nui5lint --ignore-pattern \"webapp/thirdparty/**\" \"webapp/test/e2e/**\"\n```\n\n#### `--config`\n\nLoad a custom config by relative file path (default: `./ui5lint.config.js`).\n\n**Example:**\n```sh\nui5lint --config ./ui5lint-custom.config.js\n```\n\n#### `--ui5-config`\n\nSet a path for the desired UI5 yaml config file (default: `./ui5.yaml`).\n\n**Example:**\n```sh\nui5lint --ui5-config ./configs/ui5-custom.yaml\n```\n\n#### `--log-level`\n\nSet the logging level (default: `info`).\n\nPossible values are: `silent`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `perf`, `verbose`, `silly`\n\n**Example:**\n```sh\nui5lint --log-level=warn\n```\n\n#### `--verbose`\n\nEnable verbose logging.\n\n**Example:**\n```sh\nui5lint --verbose\n```\n\n#### `--perf`\n\nEnable performance measurements and related logging.\n\n**Example:**\n```sh\nui5lint --perf\n```\n\n#### `--silent`\n\nDisable all log output.\n\n**Example:**\n```sh\nui5lint --silent\n```\n\n#### `--version`\n\nPrints the current version and CLI script location.\n\n**Example:**\n```sh\nui5lint --version\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nUI5 linter can easily be configured with an external configuration file, allowing you to customize how the linter behaves. For example, you can tell it to ignore specific files or directories. \n\n### Configuration File Location\nThe configuration file must be placed in the root directory of your project, alongside the `ui5.yaml` and `package.json` files. The linter will automatically detect and load the file when it runs.\n\n### Supported Configuration File Names\nYou can name your configuration file using one of the following formats:\n- `ui5lint.config.js`\n- `ui5lint.config.mjs`\n- `ui5lint.config.cjs`\n\nIf you need to specify a custom configuration file, you can provide it using the `--config` parameter via the command line.\n\n### Configuration File Format\n\n#### ESM (ECMAScript Modules):\n```js\nexport default {\n  ignores: [\n    \"webapp/thirdparty/**\",\n    \"webapp/test/**\",\n    \"!webapp/test/integration/**\",\n  ],\n};\n```\n\n#### CommonJS:\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  ignores: [\n    \"webapp/thirdparty/**\",\n    \"webapp/test/**\",\n    \"!webapp/test/integration/**\",\n  ],\n};\n```\n\n### Configuration Options\n\n- **ignores**: This option allows you to define glob patterns to ignore specific files or directories during linting. Patterns are relative to the root of the project. You can also un-ignore specific files by using the `!` prefix. The order of the patterns matters; later patterns override earlier ones.\n\n  **Example:**\n  ```js\n  ignores: [\n    \"webapp/test/**\",               // Ignore all files in the test folder\n    \"!webapp/test/integration/**\",  // Un-ignore files in a specific subdirectory\n  ];\n  ```\n\n  In this way, you can control which files UI5 linter should process and which it should ignore.\n\n- **files**: This option allows you to specify glob patterns to target particular files or directories for linting. However, it does not enable you to include files that are typically excluded from the process (e.g., files outside the `webapp` directory in application projects). Only POSIX path separators (`/`) are supported, irrespective of the platform you're using.\n\n  > **Note:** This option corresponds to the CLI command `ui5lint [files...]`. If CLI's `[files...]` are provided, the configuration gets ignored.\n\n  **Example:**\n\n  ```js\n  files: [\n    \"webapp/index.html\",\n    \"webapp/**/*\",        // Lint all files and subdirectories within \"webapp/\"\n  ];\n  ```\n\n## Directives\n\nUI5 linter supports directives similar to ESLint's configuration comments, allowing you to control linting rules in specific sections of your code.\n\n* **ui5lint-disable**: Disables all linting rules from the position of the comment\n* **ui5lint-enable**: Re-enables linting rules that were disabled by ui5lint-disable\n* **ui5lint-disable-line**: Disables all linting rules for the current line\n* **ui5lint-disable-next-line**: Disables all linting rules for the next line\n\n### Specifying Rules\n\n**JavaScript / TypeScript**\n\nYou can disable specific rules by listing them after the directive. Rules must be separated by commas if several are given:\n\n* `/* ui5lint-disable no-deprecated-api */`\n* `/* ui5lint-disable no-deprecated-api, no-deprecated-library */`\n* `// ui5lint-disable-line no-deprecated-api`\n\nAn explanation why a rule is disabled can be added after the rule name; it must be separated from the preceding text by two dashes:\n\n* `// ui5lint-disable-next-line no-deprecated-api -- explanation`\n\n**XML / HTML**\n\n* `<!-- ui5lint-disable no-deprecated-api -->`\n* `<!-- ui5lint-disable-next-line -->`\n* `<Text tap=\".onTap\"/> <!-- ui5lint-disable-line no-deprecated-api -->`\n\nIn XML and HTML files, depending on your browser runtime, the use of a double-hyphen `--` is usually not allowed, making it impossible to append an explanation to your directive in the same way as shown above for JavaScript / TypeScript files. You need to insert a separate comment statement in the same line of code for this purpose:\n\n* `<!-- ui5lint-disable-next-line no-deprecated-api --> <!-- explanation -->`\n\nAlso, since comments can't be placed inside XML and HTML tags, you might need to use `ui5lint-disable` and `ui5lint-enable` directives outside of the tags instead of `ui5lint-disable-line` or `ui5lint-disable-next-line`.\n\n```xml\n<!-- ui5lint-disable no-deprecated-api -->\n<Text\n  tap=\".onTap\"\n/>\n<!-- ui5lint-enable no-deprecated-api -->\n```\n\n**YAML**\n\n* `# ui5lint-disable no-deprecated-api`\n* `# ui5lint-disable-next-line`\n\n### Scope\n\nDirectives are currently supported in JavaScript and TypeScript files as well as XML, HTML and YAML files.\n\n## Node.js API\n\n### `ui5lint`\n\nThe `ui5lint` function is the main entry point for the UI5 linter. It resolves with an array of `LinterResult` objects, identical to the CLI output with the `--format json` option.\nSee the [src/index.ts](./src/index.ts) file for the available options.\n\n```js\nimport {ui5lint} from \"@ui5/linter\";\n\n// Run the linter with default options\nawait ui5lint();\n\n// Run the linter with custom options\nawait ui5lint({\n\tfilePatterns: [\"webapp/**/*.xml\"],\n\tignorePatterns: [\"webapp/thirdparty/\"],\n\tdetails: true,\n\tfix: true,\n\tconfig: \"ui5lint-foo.config.mjs\",\n\tnoConfig: true,\n\tcoverage: true,\n\tui5Config: \"ui5-lint.yaml\",\n\trootDir: \"/path/to/project\",\n});\n```\n\n### `UI5LinterEngine`\n\nThe `UI5LinterEngine` class can be used to run `ui5lint` multiple times with different options while reusing and caching common parts to improve performance.\n\n**Note:** The `lint` method can only be called once at a time. If you want to lint multiple projects in parallel, use worker threads or separate processes. The linting process is CPU-heavy and there is no benefit in parallelizing within the same Node.js process (single-threaded).\n\n```js\nimport {UI5LinterEngine} from \"@ui5/linter\";\n\nconst linterEngine = new UI5LinterEngine();\n\n// Run the linter with default options\nawait linterEngine.lint();\n\n// Run the linter with custom options\nawait linterEngine.lint({\n\tfilePatterns: [\"webapp/**/*.xml\"],\n\tignorePatterns: [\"webapp/thirdparty/\"],\n\tdetails: true,\n\tfix: true,\n\tconfig: \"ui5lint-foo.config.mjs\",\n\tnoConfig: true,\n\tcoverage: true,\n\tui5Config: \"ui5-lint.yaml\",\n\trootDir: \"/path/to/project\",\n});\n```\n\n## Internals\n\nUI5 linter makes use of the [TypeScript compiler](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/) to parse and analyze the source code (both JavaScript and TypesScript) of a UI5 project. This allows for a decent level of accuracy and performance.\n\nFor this purpose, UI5 linter provides the TypeScript compiler with the SAPUI5 [type definitions](https://sap.github.io/ui5-typescript/). The compiler can then infer the usage of UI5 classes and modules in the code. UI5 linter only needs to ask the compiler whether a given function or property is deprecated, and the compiler will provide this information with the full deprecation text.\n\nIn some cases, UI5 linter will transpile source files before analyzing them. For example, the `sap.ui.require` syntax is transpiled to `import` statements (basically ESM), so that the TypeScript compiler can understand them.\n\nSimilarly, UI5 XML views are transpiled to a JavaScript representation that can be analyzed in the same way as regular JavaScript code. In both cases, source maps are used to map any findings back to the correct line and column position in the original source code.\n\nThere are additional checks built on top of the compiler API. This applies, for example, to the usage of global variables provided by the UI5 framework (e.g. `sap.m.Button`), or to the correct usage of asynchronous component initialization.\n\nFor some checks, however, the TypeScript compiler approach is insufficient. In some of those cases, an extract of the data structure that powers the UI5 SDK is used (the so-called \"api.json\"). In other cases, the checks are hard-coded in the linter itself. For example for checks in manifest.json and HTML files.\n\n## Support, Feedback, Contributing\n\nThis project is open to feature requests/suggestions, bug reports etc. via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/UI5/linter/issues).

client such as VS Code, Cline, or any other MCP-compatible client\n\n## Setup\n\n### Standard Configuration for Most Clients\n\nThis configuration works for most MCP clients:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"mcpServers\": {\n\t\t\"@ui5/mcp-server\": {\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"stdio\",\n\t\t\t\"command\": \"npx\",\n\t\t\t\"args\": [\n\t\t\t\t\"@ui5/mcp-server\"\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe UI5 MCP server can be configured using the following environment variables. It does not accept any command-line arguments.\n\n**Custom Configuration Example:**\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"mcpServers\": {\n\t\t\"@ui5/mcp-server\": {\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"stdio\",\n\t\t\t\"command\": \"npx\",\n\t\t\t\"args\": [\n\t\t\t\t\"@ui5/mcp-server\"\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t\"env\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"UI5_MCP_SERVER_ALLOWED_ODATA_DOMAINS\": \"localhost, services.odata.org\",\n\t\t\t\t\"UI5_LOG_LVL\": \"verbose\",\n\t\t\t\t\"UI5_DATA_DIR\": \"/change-me/to/some/other/path\",\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n**Configuration Options:**\n\n* **`UI5_MCP_SERVER_ALLOWED_ODATA_DOMAINS`**:\n\t* Default Value: `localhost, services.odata.org`\n\t* Description: A comma-separated list of domains that are allowed to be used in the `oDataV4Url` parameter of the `create_ui5_app` tool, for example: `localhost, example.com, sub.example.com`. Set to an empty string to allow any domains.  \n\tFor wildcard subdomains, prefix the domain with a dot: `.example.com`. This will match `www.example.com` but not `example.com`.\n* **`UI5_MCP_SERVER_RESPONSE_NO_STRUCTURED_CONTENT`**:\n\t* Description: Set to any value to disable structured content in the MCP server responses.\n* **`UI5_MCP_SERVER_RESPONSE_NO_RESOURCES`**:\n\t* Description: Set to any value to disable [resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/resources) in the MCP server responses. This is useful for [clients that do not support resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients), such as Cursor or the Gemini CLI.\n* **`UI5_LOG_LVL`**:\n\t* Default Value: `info`\n\t* Description: Internal [log level](https://ui5.github.io/cli/stable/pages/Troubleshooting/#changing-the-log-level): `silent`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `perf`, `verbose`, `silly`\n* **`UI5_DATA_DIR`**:\n\t* Default Value: The `.ui5` directory in the user's home directory\n\t* Description: Directory where the MCP server stores its data, such as cached API references\n\n\n### Specific MCP Clients\n\n#### VS Code\n\nFollow the MCP installation [guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_add-an-mcp-server) using the above configuration.\n\nOr use the VS Code CLI:\n\n```bash\n# Using VS Code CLI\ncode --add-mcp '{\"name\":\"@ui5/mcp-server\",\"type\": \"stdio\",\"command\":\"npx\",\"args\":[\"@ui5/mcp-server\"]}'\n```\n\n#### Cline\n\n1. Open the Cline panel in VSCode.\n2. Below the prompt/task input field, click on the \"Manage MCP servers\" icon and select the gear button in the popup.\n3. Click \"Configure MCP servers\" and add the above configuration.\n\n## Rules\nThe following rules help guide the LLM to use the server correctly:\n\n```markdown\n## Guidelines for UI5\n\nUse the `get_guidelines` tool of the UI5 MCP server to retrieve the latest coding standards and best practices for UI5 development.\n```\n\nAdd these rules to your existing global or project-specific [`AGENTS.md`](https://agents.md/) (specifics may vary based on respective MCP client).\n\n## Support, Feedback, Contributing\n\nThis project is open to feature requests/suggestions, bug reports etc. via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/UI5/mcp-server/issues).

wdio-qunit-service\n\n[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/wdio-qunit-service)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wdio-qunit-service) [![test](https://github.com/mauriciolauffer/wdio-qunit-service/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mauriciolauffer/wdio-qunit-service/actions/workflows/test.yml)\n\n[WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/) (wdio) service for running [QUnit](https://qunitjs.com/) browser-based tests and dynamically converting them to `wdio` test suites.\n\n## Replacing Karma\n\n`QUnit Service` is a drop-in replacement for those using [Karma JS](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html) to run their `QUnit` tests ([karma-qunit](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-qunit/), [karma-ui5](https://github.com/SAP/karma-ui5) or any other combination of Karma and QUnit). Karma is [deprecated](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma) and people should move to modern alternatives!\n\nIf you want to keep your QUnit tests as they are, with no rewriting and no refactoring, `QUnit Service` is everything you need. It runs your QUnit HTML files in a browser and captures all the results in `wdio` format.\n\nBecause of that, developers can use `QUnit Service` in tandem with everything else available in the `wdio` ecosystem.\n\nWant to record the test run in a [video](https://webdriver.io/docs/wdio-video-reporter/)? Perhaps take a [screenshot](https://webdriver.io/docs/api/browser/saveScreenshot/) or save it in [PDF](https://webdriver.io/docs/api/browser/savePDF/)? Check the [Code coverage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wdio-monocart-service)? Save the test results in [JUnit](https://webdriver.io/docs/junit-reporter) format? Go for it, `QUnit Service` doesn't get on your way.\n\n## Installation\n\nAfter configuring `WebdriverIO`, install `wdio-qunit-service` as a devDependency in your `package.json` file.\n\n```shell\nnpm install wdio-qunit-service --save-dev\n```\n\nIf you haven't configured `WebdriverIO` yet, check the official [documentation](https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted) out.\n\n## Configuration\n\nIn order to use `QUnit Service` you just need to add it to the `services` list in your `wdio.conf.js` file. The wdio documentation has all information related to the [configuration file](https://webdriver.io/docs/configurationfile):\n\n```js\n// wdio.conf.js\nexport const config = {\n  // ...\n  services: [\"qunit\"],\n  // ...\n};\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nMake sure the web server is up and running before executing the tests. `wdio` will not start the web server.\n\n### With .spec or .test files\n\nIn your WebdriverIO test, you need to navigate to the QUnit HTML test page, then call `browser.getQUnitResults()`.\n\n```js\ndescribe(\"QUnit test page\", () => {\n  it(\"should pass QUnit tests\", async () => {\n    await browser.url(\"http://localhost:8080/test/unit/unitTests.qunit.html\");\n    await browser.getQUnitResults();\n  });\n});\n```\n\nIt's recommended to have one WebdriverIO test file per QUnit HTML test page. This ensures the tests will run in parallel and fully isolated.\n\n### Configuration only, no .spec or .test files\n\nIf you don't want to create spec/test files, you can pass a list of QUnit HTML files to the configuration and the tests will be automatically generated.\n\n```js\n// wdio.conf.js\nexport const config = {\n  // ...\n  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:8080',\n  services: [\n    ['qunit', {\n      paths: [\n        'unit-tests.html',\n        'integration-tests.html',\n        'test/qunit.html'\n      ]\n    }],\n  // ...\n};\n```\n\n### Test results\n\nTest results could look like:\n![QUnit Service test results](./wdio-qunit-service-results.png?raw=true)\n\n## Examples\n\nCheck the [examples](./examples/) folder out for samples using `javascript`, `typescript` and more.\n\n### Usage in SAP Fiori / UI5 apps\n\nStraight forward [example](./examples/openui5-sample-app/) using the well known [openui5-sample-app](https://github.com/SAP/openui5-sample-app):\n\n- Create a configuration file: [wdio.conf.js](./examples/openui5-sample-app/webapp/test/wdio.conf.js)\n\n- Tell `wdio` where to find the QUnit test files:\n\n- - Include the QUnit files to the [service configuration](./examples/openui5-sample-app-no-specs/webapp/test/wdio.conf.js)\n- - or\n- - Create a WebdriverIO test file for [unit tests](./examples/openui5-sample-app/webapp/test/unit/unit.test.js) and another for [OPA5 tests](./examples/openui5-sample-app/webapp/test/integration/opa.test.js)\n\n- The web server must be running before executing the tests\n\n- Run it $ `wdio run webapp/test/wdio.conf.js`\n\n## Author\n\nMauricio Lauffer\n\n- LinkedIn:

🎯 Features\n\n- ✨ **Seamless Integration**: Use Font Awesome icons with standard UI5 Icon controls\n- 🎨 **3 Icon Styles**: Regular, Solid, and Brand icons\n\n## 📋 Icon Mapping\n\n| Font Awesome Style | UI5 Namespace           | Example Usage                                           |\n| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `fa-regular`       | `sap-icon://fa-regular` | `<Icon src=\"sap-icon://fa-regular/face-grin-hearts\" />` |\n| `fa-solid`         | `sap-icon://fa-solid`   | `<Icon src=\"sap-icon://fa-solid/face-grin-hearts\" />`   |\n| `fa-brands`        | `sap-icon://fa-brands`  | `<Icon src=\"sap-icon://fa-brands/github\" />`            |\n\n## 🛠️ Setup & Configuration\n\nAdd the `fontawesome.icons.lib` library dependency to your `manifest.json` and follow one of the next methods. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"minUI5Version\": \"1.120.33\",\n    \"libs\": {\n      \"sap.ui.core\": {},\n      \"sap.m\": {},\n      \"fontawesome.icons.lib\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf using TypeScript, add `ui5-fontawesome-lib` to `types` definition.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"types\": [\n      \"@sapui5/ts-types-esm\",\n      \"ui5-fontawesome-lib\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Method 1: Using NPM Package (Recommended)\n\nInstall Dependencies\n\n```bash\nnpm i ui5-fontawesome-lib\n```\n\nThat should be it. The UI5 tooling will recognize the UI5 dependency (verifiable via UI5 CLI command `UI5 tree`) and take care of loading it for you.\n\n#### with UI5 middleware (alternative recommendation)\n\n```bash\nnpm i ui5-fontawesome-lib && npm i -D ui5-middleware-servestatic\n```\n\nAdd the following configuration to your `ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-middleware-servestatic\n      afterMiddleware: compression\n      mountPath: /resources/fontawesome/icons/lib/\n      configuration:\n        npmPackagePath: 'ui5-fontawesome-lib/dist/resources/fontawesome/icons/lib'\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using CDN\n\nAdd `https://cdn.kernich.de/ui5-fontawesome-lib/resources/fontawesome/icons/lib` to your resource roots for `fontawesome.icons.lib`\n\n```HTML\n<script\n  id=\"sap-ui-bootstrap\"\n  src=\"https://sdk.openui5.org/resources/sap-ui-core.js\"\n  data-sap-ui-resource-roots='{\n    \"my.example.app\": \"./\",\n    \"fontawesome.icons.lib\": \"https://cdn.kernich.de/ui5-fontawesome-lib/resources/fontawesome/icons/lib\"\n  }'\n  data-sap-ui-on-init=\"module:sap/ui/core/ComponentSupport\"\n  data-sap-ui-compat-version=\"edge\"\n  data-sap-ui-frame-options=\"trusted\"\n  data-sap-ui-async=\"true\"\n></script>\n```\n\n### Method 3: Local setup (for development)\n\nClone this repository and add it as a dependency to your local UI5 project setup.\n\n## 💻 Usage Examples\n\n### Basic Icon Usage\n\n```xml\n<!-- Regular icons -->\n<Icon src=\"sap-icon://fa-regular/heart\" />\n\n<!-- Solid icons -->\n<Icon src=\"sap-icon://fa-solid/star\" />\n\n<!-- Brand icons -->\n<Icon src=\"sap-icon://fa-brands/github\" />\n```\n\n### With Icon Properties\n\n```xml\n<Icon \n    src=\"sap-icon://fa-solid/rocket\" \n    size=\"2rem\" \n    color=\"#0070f3\" \n    tooltip=\"Launch application\" />\n```\n\n### In JavaScript/TypeScript\n\n```typescript\nimport Icon from \"sap/ui/core/Icon\";\n\nconst icon = new Icon({\n    src: \"sap-icon://fa-solid/check-circle\",\n    size: \"1.5rem\",\n    color: \"green\"\n});\n```\n\n## 🎨 Font Awesome Pro Support\n\nWant to use Font Awesome Pro icons?
